Machine learning can mean a *lot* of different things. At its most basic, it can be described as "giving a computer some inputs and some outcomes, and letting the computer figure out the relationship between the two."

## Finding outliers with Linear Regression

We know the outcome. Do we find some of those outcomes suspicious?

> Almost every single it's used in investigative reporting it's for school testing! [The AP did one about life expectancy](https://investigate.ai/ap-regression-unemployment/) but it's not very investigative and more similar to how we'll read logistic regression.

### Example: School Testing

## Finding bias with Logistic Regression

We know the outcome. Is something disproportionately affecting that outcome?

## Letting a machine do the work with Classification

We label some of our data. Can a machine do the rest?
