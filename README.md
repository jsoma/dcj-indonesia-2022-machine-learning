Machine learning can mean a *lot* of different things. At its most basic, it can be described as "giving a computer some inputs and some outcomes, and letting the computer figure out the relationship between the two."

## Finding outliers with Linear Regression

We know the outcome. Do we find some of those outcomes suspicious?

* [Dallas Morning News on cheating schools](https://investigate.ai/dmn-texas-school-cheating/) + [original story](http://clipfile.org/?p=754) + [A PDF version with images](linear-regression-cheating-schools/TexasSchoolCheating.pdf)
* [Unemployment and life expectancy](https://investigate.ai/ap-regression-unemployment/) from the AP (but it's not very investigative!)

## Finding bias with Logistic Regression

We know the outcome. Is something disproportionately affecting that outcome?

## Letting a machine do the work with Classification

We label some of our data. Can a machine do the rest?

### Example: Julia Ingram therapy app reviews

This was from one of my students!

Julia Ingram researched and wrote [Hundreds of teletherapy app users report unresponsive therapists, unfair charges](https://juliaingram.github.io/therapy-apps/) over the course of about two weeks only a few months after learning Python. Be inspired!* You can find [her code here](https://github.com/juliaingram/therapy-app-reviews).
