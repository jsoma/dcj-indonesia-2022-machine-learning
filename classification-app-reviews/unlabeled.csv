I don‚Äôt write app reviews, but there is no way to get any type of response from customer service. I was a brand new paying subscriber that needed assistance with a billing/technical issue. I‚Äôve reached out via email multiple times for a week with no response, which is valuable time and money going down the drain as I wait on customer service to respond to what should be a simple request. 
After many automated emails, I went to social media dms to try to get ahold of someone. My question could easily have been taken care of with a quick phone call but they don‚Äôt offer any type of customer service phone call. 
This has created much more stress and frustration on me, all while my paid subscription dwindles down. I was now charged for TWO different subscriptions that Im not using. You‚Äôve been unable to assist me in a simple request so PAY ME BACK‚Ä¶.all of it. This ‚Äúpartial refund‚Äù automated refund wizard thing isn‚Äôt the right approach. I never used your services, only spent time trying to figure out how to get set up correctly!
Take This Advice CS- If you don‚Äôt have enough customer service support to handle new clients, pause taking in new subscribers until you can fully serve them. Week long delays and keeping my money is not right. I‚Äôm done trying to make Talkspace work for me on my own. 
Bottom line - I‚Äôve cancelled my account(s) and I expect Full Refunds now.",texasbaby27,Refund. Me. Now.,1,False,2021-10-29 13:00:33,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386
,"I was initially matched with a therapist that specialized in a subject that I had no issues with nor did I specify I had issues with. I had to accept in order to try to change therapists, only one of which was female (which is what I wanted) so I had to accept that.. but I felt like I wished I had more choices to pick from. My therapist was nice. Very generic though, and didn‚Äôt know how to use the platform. Promised to email me something and never did. Red flags raised when she cancelled our second appointment together but we rescheduled in the same week. I really wanted routine and continuity‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt want to switch providers at this point after already going through a really tough first appointment. So I stuck with the same provider. Fast forward, she cancelled our 4th appointment, rescheduled it for two days later, then I waited on video and she never showed up and didn‚Äôt message til the next day with a pretty tepid sorry. I called (to no avail) and emailed Talkspace to share this and show my disappointment and yes I got a refund, but no apology for being treated as unimportant or uncared for. Talkspace was my therapist‚Äôs side gig so clearly not as important as her full time job which is fine if that‚Äôs ok with you. But it took its toll on me. Will not continue.

Upon telling her about my experience with Talkspace, she was very concerned and told me that this was extremely unsafe and could‚Äôve been so much worse if I was in a worse place mentally. I was also misdiagnosed and given very incorrect medication, which negatively impacted my life. Please please don‚Äôt jeopardize your mental health.

I am in MA and I specifically requested to be matched with a female provider. For 2 weeks, the app was only matching me with male providers. I almost gave up but finally saw 1 female provider I could choose. As we started working together, the advice I was getting was very generic, stuff you already know and can read on the internet: for ex., have you tried meditation or breathing exercises? I asked my colleagues who also use this service and they were having the same experiences. It felt like my provider was not even paying attention to half of the stuff I was saying. In the end, I switched to a real psychologist from my insurance network. It is so much more helpful than getting these generic advices over text that I can already predict the responses to. I don‚Äôt think the selection criteria to become a Talkspace provider is very high. They just train people to provide some generic responses. If you really need help and want to see progress, don‚Äôt waste your time. As for the app itself, why isn‚Äôt there an option to freeze your account for more than 1 week?

one month of unlimited messaging therapy as a gift. For over a week I checked my account and contacted customer service to see if my gift card had been applied to my account, as it did not show that on the app. Finally someone told me that it had been. At this point I‚Äôve wasted almost two weeks. Their providers are also slow to respond and when they do, the responses seem scripted or canned. I switched providers after my first counselor only had me fill out questionnaires only to receive no feedback or fill me in on what was happening. The second counselor seemed promising & after sending her a detailed message (at her request), she finally replied that she had resigned from Talkspace and they would match me with someone else.

The first therapist didn‚Äôt even answer me on chat, just told me we would talk about it in the appointment which I didn‚Äôt want to do, and the second one got short with me and seemed frustrated when I expressed my desire to use the texting feature. 
I just need someone to ask me questions to help me figure out what‚Äôs going on in my mind and then help me learn how to heal it. This is definitely doable with a chat feature. I am able to communicate much more honestly and learn way better this way. Maybe the therapists will get more used to this kind of communication.

First interaction with the person assigning you to a therapist was great, immediate responses and good support explaining how the service works. As soon as I was assigned my first therapist though it went immediately downhill, they had no availability for appointments and when I asked over chat the therapist responded (rudely) saying they were overbooked and way over their allotted appointment number. They then probably realized I was a customer for help and not a bot/scheduler asking and changed their tone but they still could not take me and could not help me find a new therapist who did have time. I reached out to customer support to help me change therapist but I had no response (over one week to this date). I finally figured out that rating the therapist negatively would allow me to change provider and after doing that and trying my best to pick someone who according to the app had matching availability / experience I got stuck with someone who had just a 10 min slot 2 months away. So once again I am in a position where I cant change therapist so the money I paid for this month looks

I understand that therapists are busy and its hard to book appointments but you cant have a monthly paid service in which you recommend unavailable people to new subscribers and give them no way out or support.

* Have had to cancel/reschedule because the app isn‚Äôt working
* Lost half a session troubleshooting why they couldn‚Äôt see or hear me in the room and vice versa
* The app has blocked my counselor from booking sessions when we try to reschedule
* Sessions have disappeared from their calendar
* The app has allowed them to double book causing them to have to cancel
* Customer support is MIA and takes weeks to get back to you so don‚Äôt expect technical support

All this is when you finally get a counselor. Signing up for a counselor who is a good fit and has availability is a nightmare. 

Previously I was using better help and it just worked. You take a survey and you get matched with providers who specialize in the areas you want to work on. Easy. 

Talkspace shows you three people and in my case they did not have the expertise I specified. I decided to give it a chance and try someone. Well they had no availability for 3 weeks. And it was sparse after that. Not to mention their schedule was 7am-1pm, which did not fit my schedule. I went to switch counselors but the app requires you to rate counselors before switching. I reached out to Talkspace to see if they could help. A few days went by and I figured I was on my own so I rated them 4 stars to move on. Talkspace got back to me 3 weeks later. 

I ended up with a therapist I liked because the second time around I hit refresh to see providers until I could get a hint from the tiny bio that they might have expertise in areas I needed. The problem is that when you refresh those matches the previous ones are gone if you decide you‚Äôd like to go back to someone. It feels a bit like the app is removing choice in a way that is counter to therapy. The therapeutic relationship is super important it needs to be a good fit or you do more damage than help.

My therapist is great but we have had technical issues 90% of my sessions that result in canceling, rescheduling or losing lots of session time. This kind of makes therapy impossible. I‚Äôve reached out to be credited for lost sessions but still haven‚Äôt heard back.

Although the therapist I was matched with was awesome, the frustrations with the app and how payment is structured lead me to quit and also lose about $400.
Note: I have been doing different forms of teletherapy for a few years now, including using BetterHelp. While not perfect, I still believe the pros outweigh the cons of teletherapy vs in person .
1. Talkspaces payment method gives you ‚Äúcredits‚Äù for therapy sessions . I paid $400/month for the privilege  of scheduling 4 therapy sessions in a month. If you don‚Äôt use them, you lose them in the next billing cycle .
2. You can‚Äôt just set up a weekly time to meet with your therapist. Instead, every month you need to schedule for that month. So, if you forget to schedule right away, you may miss a week or a few.
3. If your therapist does not have times available, then you are out of luck. This would not be a problem if you could just schedule a set time every week to meet with your therapist. This is how typical therapy as well as Better Help works . 
4. I had to reschedule a session prior to when the scheduled session took places. My therapist was fine with rescheduling , but without my knowledge I got charged an extra $65 dollars for the session . My therapist was not aware that this would happen either. 
5. Finally, For the month of March I had 3 sessions scheduled using the credits I had already paid for. However, because i chose to not renew my monthly subscription, with a renewal on March 10- the system shut me out on the last day of the billing period , even though I still had sessions scheduled that were prepaid for. So, I essentially paid $400 to just have one session . 
As someone with anxiety, this app made my anxiety worse . I would tell any therapists or clients  to avoid this app at all costs, it is not worth the confusion and frustration .",unhappy_and_worseoff,Do not use this app,1,False,2022-03-13 16:17:17,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386

I have nothing bad to say about my limited experience with the app. That being said, let‚Äôs talk price. I‚Äôve been in therapy since I was 10. After years of 280 dollar sessions with my therapist, my parents must have been financially exhausted. After insurance no longer covered some of the cost for me, I had to step away from therapy, my medication was no longer available, and my mental illnesses grew worse and worse. Talk space, though it may be a convenient and useful tool for those too busy to go to therapy or those who do not have an office readily available to them, is not a better alternative financially. It‚Äôs VERY expensive. Like 60 bucks a week expensive, or more if you choose a package not as limited. So please be aware of that, and if you can afford it then I suggest you give it a shot.

I know that my insurance paid $71 per week (audio and texting therapy, twice per week ). My therapist made $22 of that (We had some billing issues and I became privy to this information). I mean, come on!!! At least pay them half.

Why? 
1) they deserve it
2) it encourages high therapist turn over. It‚Äôs really devastating to a patient to have your therapist leave. Especially, as you can imagine, the patients that come on this platform.

Regarding the app, it works pretty well:

1) I wish it had a feature that kept your phone from turning off while you‚Äôre talking.
2) I accidentally pressed a button once and started a session with a new therapist. To backtrack, I basically had to leave a bad review for that therapist. That feels bad.
3) Fix the billing issues and make it easier for your therapists to get paid

For starters, I don‚Äôt necessarily find the app to be user friendly. It isn‚Äôt the easiest to navigate if you want to figure out if you‚Äôve scheduled any appointments or just want to poke around in settings. From there, the match coach isn‚Äôt much help. You‚Äôre given some options after taking a short assessment, but if you don‚Äôt find anyone you‚Äôd feel you can connect with, you can only see new matches two additional times before having to start the quiz over, Input all of your information all over again just to receive the same options as before. 

You can contact their CX team via the app which is great and after taking a loon I figured it would be a live chat but I shortly received an email notification stating I‚Äôd be contacted shortly. Not too sure why it would be set up as a chat interface if it isn‚Äôt that. I still haven‚Äôt received any information about any of the therapist I thought I scheduled (selected a therapist, date, time and all), no contact back from the matching coach, or from the CX team.

I was suggested a therapist that worked with male issues and I am a female, and one that worked with porn addiction which is no where even NEAR the other neurological disorder I have. When I asked if there was a way my marcher could recommend me more specific options she simply didn‚Äôt respond. I went through multiple pages of therapists and they got more and more random as I went on. The only person that could help me was my matches that had read my message and not responded for over 24 hours. I eventually asked again if there was a way she could help me refine the results and yet again she didn‚Äôt respond, the bare minimum she could have said was that it‚Äôs too specific for her to know. But radio silence from someone who is supposed to be a professional helping me is unacceptable. There is also no other way to find a therapist, and there is no way to switch even if they are not helping or responding at all. Eventually when I asked how to get a refund after her not responding to my past 2 messages asking for help she responded immediately but did not address anything from my 2 messages before that one.

I was hoping to be able to just talk to a professional over the phone on my way home from work some days. This app is definitely not that. I didn‚Äôt really understand until I got into it but the cheapest plan they offer is $65 per week. This only includes two text messages a day from a therapist. So $260 a month to get 2 replies a day. There is also no guarantee that these replies are going to be at all helpful. I have heard maybe one piece of useful advice from a therapist on this app. I feel like I can pour my heart out to a therapist and then 4 days later(due to the therapist you choose only working a few days a week) I might get a message that says something vague like ‚Äúwhat do you think makes you feel that way?‚Äù I don‚Äôt see how this app is helpful to anyone with a real issue with depression or that genuinely needs a person to talk to. The only way to get more interaction is to upgrade to their higher plans. Those can cost up to 400/ month. So then you basically get a few live video chats for a car payment. I  don‚Äôt know how expensive normal therapy is, however I feel I could pay anyone $400 per month and get more useful help than I have gotten from this app. I changed therapists because of some of the issues I have stated, and since I changed therapists on Friday I have gotten 1 message from her. She is apparently off on weekends, but here it is, 5pm on a Monday and still no sign of life that anyone is going to try and give me any kind of help.

,"Beware!  There seems to be no where to review talkspace besides the App Store,Otherwise I would not use this for him. The app is fine and works functionally. The therapist x 2 I have used have been great.  The talkspace service is awful. Customer service is awful and doesn‚Äôt reply to any messages or inquiries except for automated options.  I signed up and paid in advance for six months including one live session a week because it seemed very cost effective. The first month was great but then my therapist and I could never coordinate schedules for my live sessions. They appeared to be rolling over, so I wasn‚Äôt stressed.  After several months of only being able to coordinate a handful of live sessions, I decided I really needed to change therapists.  I reached out for advice from customer service on that and also whether my insurance would help cover some of the talkspace fees. Three messages to talk space and not a single reply.  I gave up trying and since I didn‚Äôt want to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings so I decided to put my therapy on pause and during that pause it appeared that my live sessions were on hold with it. The app actually show that I had six live sessions that expired after my pause ended. Everything came off pause in November, I had one life session and then the rest disappeared and even though I am paid in full through the middle of January,  it appears that I have no live sessions. Customer service will not reply to my inquiries. Basically I‚Äôve spent nearly $1900 for a handful of text messages back-and-forth to a therapist and for live 30 minute sessions. It‚Äôs an incredible waste of money and frustrating to not have anyone in customer service communicate because everything is completely online through chat support. Well this is a great concept its functionality is limited and I suspect they grew too fast to really provide any sort of good service.

This app might be good for someone working through a temporary issue, but for anyone with chronic mental health issues I‚Äôd advise you steer clear. 
The process to match up with a therapist was easy to navigate and user friendly, however, after getting matched up with a therapist it was like they weren‚Äôt even reading what I was writing to them. They‚Äôd asked if I had been in therapy before after I had already stated that. Then they asked what brought me to talk space after I had literally just finished explaining myself. After that I was directed to the talkspace bookshelf and wasn‚Äôt really sure where to go from there. I was lucky to get a sentence or two a day from my therapist in response to paragraphs. I was also supposed to get a complimentary video chat that was never initiated. My therapist stopped checking in with me and I considered getting another,  but I figured it was better to cancel before the month was up before losing out on more money. With the pandemic going on I figured this was the only way to get counseling, but I‚Äôd rather wait until things open back up since this was more expensive and less convenient than actual in person therapy.

,"I used Talkspace for almost two years, but quit the platform when my therapist wouldn‚Äôt stop harassing me when I tried to talk to her about my racial identity. When I asked, she told me she was qualified to talk about racial issues. But when I first raised the issue, her instant response was ‚ÄúAll lives matter,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am not going to talk about politics.‚Äù In the wake of the worldwide protests against racism, she tried to walk it back and said that she only said those things because she did not want me to take on too much for other people. She also said, ‚ÄúI am not racist.‚Äù  And, she said that I needed to apologize to her, because how dare I attack her and make all these assumptions about her. If this is not the textbook example of weaponizing white privilege, I do not know what is. I tried to go back to the platform to select a therapist that could work with me on racial issues, but there is no option for that. At the same time, Talkspace has touted itself on its Instagram and website as being aware and committed to helping BIPOC with issues related to race in America. (Which it only did in the wake of George Floyd‚Äôs death.)

I believe this is an important issue to raise because Talkspace is a mental health service, and mental health issues often affect BIPOC in unexamined ways. Further, I am a healthcare attorney, and I am acutely aware that BIPOC remain underserved in the area of mental health. 

All in all, I would not trust Talkspace to provide BIPOC the same level of care it provides its white clients.",TrueBlue2005,Not for BIPOCs,2,False,2020-10-11 03:14:28,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386

So I did one month of this talkspace during a crisis period in my life. I give two stars for my actual therapist who has nothing to do with the app itself. I wanted to cancel after a month and customer service took two weeks to respond, making me freak out that they‚Äôd charge me $400 or so, I had to freeze my credit card and pause my subscription to avoid it. Finally they reply offering me a discount, and I accepted that offer. But they charged my credit card actually MORE than the subscription- negating my discount and then some. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll resolve it in two weeks but it‚Äôs already in my card statement, the damage is done.

Talkspace will repeatedly lure you into giving them your money and then not giving you value. I switched to a different plan mid-month, assuming that since I paid for a month in full already, the new, cheaper plan would take effect after the end of the current cycle. Nope. My therapist was like ‚Äòwell I‚Äôll talk to you in a week!‚Äô I was shocked. Customer service will of course take two weeks to reply like last time, so by then my plan will be expired anyway, making the whole exercise of contacting them pointless. I‚Äôm so so mad. They just take advantage of people!

Update: the second time they robbed me, they are also taking away time I paid them for therapy. I write to support every day for five days, no reply. They have added so much stress to my life and cut off my connection to my therapist. I paid for the time till September 13 yet after that I wanted to b downgraded my plan - they downgraded it right away last Friday. And I‚Äôve lost two weeks of $$ I paid.

,"So I joined about 2 weeks ago and so far I wish I hadn‚Äôt because I haven‚Äôt had much in terms of therapy. They rarely reply and when they do it‚Äôs not much help. Not to mention that not every therapist has the same certification some are social workers/counselors I‚Äôm not sure if they mean schoolers or AA counselors. Honestly charging $200 a month for a couple of emails is crazy.
The first therapist I was matched to was nice but only replied to me once a day. Even though they says you get 2-3 replies. When he replied to me the replies felt kind of like self help quotes and he would say what I told him back to me. For example, if I said ‚ÄúI want help establish boundaries with my family because they do this, this, and this,‚Äù his reply would be something like ‚Äúyour feelings are valid and it‚Äôs important to establish boundaries‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was normal like in the beginning of therapy so I stuck it out for a week. 
Once a week passed I decided to switch therapist so I took matching quiz again, the people that were recommended were all social workers and didn‚Äôt seem to match any of the focuses i had selected. So I took the quiz again and got matched to more social workers that didn‚Äôt match any of my focus. I did it again and the same thing happened so I asked to speak with an agent. She tried to match me to some people but the people available weren‚Äôt much better, that‚Äôs when the agent explained that due to COVID they have been under staffed so at the moment they won‚Äôt be able match me correctly. I get that they are understaffed but they‚Äôre offering a service that‚Äôs pricy so they should make sure to have enough therapist available. I didn‚Äôt say this to the agent though because it‚Äôs not her fault it‚Äôs really talkspace‚Äôs fault. I eventually got matched to someone. 
Once I got my other therapist I was excited and asked her a couple questions. She took a day to reply to me and when I replied to her she never got back to me. I‚Äôm still waiting to hear from her. The first therapist at least got back to me by the end of the day but she takes one to two days to reply.

I had an in-person therapist who helped wonders, but I just couldn‚Äôt afford it after my money ran out. I was hoping for an affordable option that could help when the panic attacks hit, and this sounded promising. I was able to choose a woman who specialized in abusive relationships and trauma and was excited at the thought of getting some sort of healing. Did I expect this to be just as great as my in-person therapist? Absolutely not. But I was definitely hoping to continue something, at least, to keep me going. 

I wasn‚Äôt able to get her schedule until I chose her and couldn‚Äôt go back. That was quite a bummer considering she was only available one day a week for two hours. And her responses to my texts? ‚ÄúYou can do this... Keep going... How does that make you feel?... I know this can be hard, but you‚Äôre strong...‚Äù It felt like I was scrolling Pinterest quotes for an insane price. She would text me back only once and when I would respond quickly, I wouldn‚Äôt hear back until the next week. I didn‚Äôt even get her for those two hours. I‚Äôm past that problem, now my anxiety-ridden brain is onto something else since a week has gone by. She didn‚Äôt offer calls or video chats either.

I understand Talk Space is most likely a side gig for therapists who work full-time in an office, but holy cow. I felt worse coming out of it than going in. Lost my money, lost my time, lost my dignity crying over a phone waiting for a text back to make me feel better. Sound like a familiar scenario?

I try not to blame the therapist for a poor set up, but also, why offer potential life-saving services at two hours a week if they can‚Äôt be maintained? Maybe I got the short end of the stick. I only had a month to test it and then I had to pay full price. There was an option to try another therapist, but maybe there should be an option to not have to pay that entire price until you find someone you can connect with? When I had insurance, my EAP offered six free sessions per issue until I found the right person. And when I found her, I stuck with her until my money ran out. I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôd like to think people would pay for it and stick with it if it meant saving themselves. 

Maybe offer tiers in pricing depending on what the therapist offers? If they only offer texting, of they offer calls, video calls, two or all three? I felt cheated to be expected to pay so much money for one text a week that never went anywhere. I haven‚Äôt checked TalkSpace lately, so I‚Äôm not sure if this part has changed.

First, the website directs you through multiple steps including getting your payment option for what I realized was not an agreed upon term for the customer. You haven‚Äôt chosen a counsellor, you‚Äôve just entered in your information, including payment. Doesn‚Äôt feel good. 

Then I only received 2 options for counselors, one was not appropriate to my selected goals so I chose the other. It didn‚Äôt feel good. 

Then I tried to set a tome to meet this therapist, there were only 2 options, 10 minutes or 45 (not even the standard counseling session, considering they‚Äôre certainly charging $120 per week which which you could pay and see a counsellor in person for 55 minutes to an hour.) 

I chose 10 minutes and lo and behold this counsellor doesn‚Äôt even have calendar space and I get a message that there‚Äôs no availability for 3 weeks. Well, so I‚Äôll be charged $120 a week to ‚Äútext‚Äù with thsi person who I haven‚Äôt even spoken to or know will be a good fit, while I wait to have 10 minutes... that‚Äôs absolutely insane. 

This service either can‚Äôt keep up with demand or is just plain awful but even customer service to find reassignment was a huge pain.

,"To start this off I really never leave reviews for anything unless I feel like it‚Äôs really a major issue that people beware of - It‚Äôs actually irresponsible this app is allowed to operate. Please avoid using this app if you need reliable help and here is why:

I‚Äôve done in person therapy pre-pandemic so I know what it‚Äôs supposed to be like. Because of the pandemic I decided to give virtual therapy a try with Talkspace. The first issue is there were slim picking for providers - which is strange to me since it‚Äôs a virtual service it‚Äôs not like the provider has to be in your city, but this is minor. When I did finally land on a provider it was fine at first but then he very quickly became unreliable - which was the second issue. Some people opt to message throughout the week - I opt for the 60 minute session once a week. The provider was egregiously late on more than one occasion or would simply cancel at the last minute - which they charge you for anyways even if the cancellation is on the provider end. 

The third issue is there often seems to be glitches with the app itself or providers are not adequately trained in the interface or with the technology. There were several instances where I wanted to book another session with the provider and he simply wasn‚Äôt doing the after session wrap-up on his end to allow the app to provider another available session to book. I had to remind him of this several times until I eventually got tired of having to do this. There were several weeks where I would have booked sessions where I simply wasn‚Äôt able to do it was a very haphazard schedule. The fourth issue here is you are completely at the mercy of the providers schedule. They can either forget to allow you to book, or cancel a session at will with no consequences. In regular therapy this could also be an issue but when I had an in person therapist they almost never cancelled and were much more cognizant of my time and keeping a regular treatment schedule.

Once I realized this was actually mentally exhausting me I decided to switch providers to see if that would alleviate. The second provider was a no-show on the intro session. So clearly Talkspace isn‚Äôt really vetting providers well and definitely aren‚Äôt monitoring their service in any meaningful way. Which brings me to the final issue - there is no customer service number. Big red flag for any service. You cannot call and speak to a representation you have to submit a ticket with your complaint and wait for a response. This could take anywhere from a week to a month or more and from my experience it‚Äôs more on the longer side. I did it once and realized it was futile. 

In conclusion this app is terrible for your mental health actually. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone seeking reliable mental help especially if you‚Äôre desperate it would most likely push you over the edge. Not sure how the psych board lets this kind of malpractice fly - mental health is a serious thing.",sg2020nov,UNRELIABLE - DO NOT USE,1,False,2020-12-01 01:51:30,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386

My therapist sent me one text a day, asking for clarification on things I went into extreme detail about. Then she wouldn‚Äôt do anything with the extra information I gave her. She just moved on. I expressed frustration, but she made it seem like it was my fault, so I dropped it.

About two weeks I asked her to hold me accountable with some goals. I figure if she‚Äôs only gonna text me once, she can at least check to make sure I‚Äôm doing what I want to be doing, but she didn‚Äôt. She didn‚Äôt check on me for a week. And I really needed help during that week. What could have been a small conversation turned into me staying inside for 4 days.

This past week (our final week together), we‚Äôve mostly been trying to schedule a video call because she has a different schedule than what‚Äôs on Talkspace and many in person clients who are clearly the priority. However, we weren‚Äôt able to figure it out and now I won‚Äôt get to use it. 

Additionally she never talked about making a plan based on what I told her. We never went over any assessments. (Besides her literally reading the results. I know what the answers say I wrote them.) Nor did we talk about the Talkspace program itself. So it looks like there are a lot of really cool features that I missed out on.

I love the idea of Talkspace and think it could have been a perfect tool for me. Unfortunately, my first two providers took days to reply to my simple messages, and when they did finally reply, I was usually given an unhelpful and generic sentence or two.

Seeing as the app has an immediate option to offer this kind of thing, I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre used to people complaining about providers taking so long. 

After my first provider abruptly left TalkSpace and my second provider stopped responding altogether, I found someone who I actually connected with. She said she was training to become a full-time employee of TalkSpace and I was excited to have more time with her. What I didn't know was that if I wanted to have that time with her beyond a quick message here and there, I had to pay $65 for a 30-minute video session on top of the monthly fee I already pay. Needless to say, I wasn‚Äôt going to do that. I'm not paying $200+ a month to get a one-sentence message every other day, and I'm certainly not going to pay more for a video session knowing that the quality of service will likely be lacking (if the rest of TalkSpace is any indication). 

I find it noble that TalkSpace wants to make therapy more accessible to more people, but I'm starting to wonder how much of that is just a facade to get people to cough up more money for a lackluster service. If you‚Äôre considering using TalkSpace, please know what you‚Äôre paying for. It is not traditional therapy, but rather a sporadic message here or there, with some generic worksheets tacked on. If you‚Äôre willing to pay for the video sessions, your experience may be better than mine.

', 'modified': '2021-02-18T18:35:33Z'}","I signed up for Talkspace in the beginning of January thinking Telehealth might be my best option. I quickly realized its not for me. I paid for the 6 month service to save money. If I signed up for a bulk of months, I saved like 30%. The total cost for 24/7 chat thread, 4 video chats a month and unlimited voicemail services for 6 months was $1896. 

They set you up with a matching agent to find out what kind of provider you're looking for. Great. 

The first provider I matched with ignored me for days and wouldn't confirm any of the video chat appointments I scheduled (and paid for with my package) which ultimately led to them being canceled at the last minute. I decided she didn't work for what I needed so the matching agent started to match me with other therapists. 

She matched me with therapists that had no available appointments, dealt with mainly pediatric patients, or their language was Spanish which I don't speak. It was added stress when I was looking to speak to someone about the stress I already had. I grew frustrated. 

The next provider I thought I successfully matched with was super attentive, but was really reluctant to video chat with me even though it was a service I paid for. Every time I scheduled a video chat, she asked me if it was ""really necessary"" or if I would prefer a phone call instead. When I finally got her to video chat with me, I was left with a frozen screen on her side showing a wall and the tippy top of her forehead for the entire 45 minutes. The things she talked during the video chat where strange and not ""therapist-y"" at all. She started to talk about HER prolems. She was almost childish in the way she spoke. I didn't feel like she was taking me seriously and there was something... off... about her speech. I ended the video chat feeling anxious, blamed and ridiculous. Like I offered her more advice than she offered me. I threw her name into a simple google search and found out she has severe mental disabilities. Im not even entirely sure she's qualified for a therapist position because I could find very little on her education experiences. I only found articles from when her and her family were interviewed about her disabilities. 

I decided I didn't want to waste any more time searching for a therapist with this service who has provided me with nothing but more stress and aggravation. So I canceled my subscription and asked for a refund. They canceled my membership and immediately told me they were sending me a refund for $1882. It was $14 less than I paid but I figured that was fine since that's about what I would pay for the janky services I received.

A week went by and I checked my account to make sure the refund went through. Thats when I found out that it did, but they also charged me again. $276 came out of my account and I emailed to ask why. Their website provides NO PHONE NUMBER to contact an actual human. A few days went by with no response so I emailed AGAIN.... no response. 

Just this weekend I get an email saying ""Thank you for your purchase."" They charged me an ADDITIONAL $396 and told me my next payment will be taken on March 14th. 

So during this past month when I have had NO SUBSCRIPTION with their service, they have charged me $672 total. 

I have emailed multiple times with no response. I signed on to my Talkspace page and it clearly states I have no subscription and that I canceled on January 19th. I tried to remove my CC information they have stored and it wouldn't let me. I tried to enter false cc information thinking it wouldn't go through the next time they tried to charge me and they would then, of course, try and contact me.... but it wouldn't let me do that either. 

I put my FBI cap on. Since there's no phone number anywhere on their website, I googled their physical address. Then I googled the phone number for that address. I called it and it was an automated Talkspace voicemail machine. I left a message and still no response. 

Thats when I decided to make this post. I tried to be an adult about this, but lately companies only seem to respond when they're publicly bashed on the internet. 

Im not normally a Karen, but Im prepared to go full Karen over the $672 Talkspace owes me. Thats a lot of money that we've been robbed of. I also want my cc information deleted from their program so this can not happen again. 

I would love a response to my emails or voicemails asap.

Without warning, without indication she was taking time away, my therapist stopped responding to messages, there was no formal termination of care, and I haven‚Äôt been able to get ahold of her for 3 months now. I can see that she has ‚Äúread‚Äù texts I‚Äôve sent, but they go unanswered. She literally just ghosted on me. I am mentally vulnerable and was dealing with a lot during the Covid pandemic, self isolating for over 400 days due to being high risk. Talkspace doesn‚Äôt provide you with any sort of recourse for a situation like this. To make matters worse, there are apparently ‚Äúno records‚Äù covering my care from my therapist, so if I wanted to change providers (inside OR outside of talkspace), I‚Äôm going to have to start from literally ground zero. Over 2 years of therapy on talkspace is over $5,000 worth of time that I have spent working on many topics with my therapist, and talkspace is not doing much to help me get my records (which are legally my property). This company treats mental health patients as if they are using a service like Uber. They don‚Äôt hold themselves accountable when things go wrong. I‚Äôm constantly told how my ‚Äúconcerns are being escalated‚Äù but nothing changes. Now, after being abandoned by a provider I trusted and worked with for 2 YEARS, I am afraid to trust another provider. It will take me months, if not years to recover from the trauma of being abandoned by my therapist when I really needed her. Talkspace offers me no solutions of how I can get my records or what I can do. There‚Äôs no consequence for the abandonment and I had to fight to get money back for the weeks I went without therapy. 
I‚Äôm disappointed‚Äî the concept could‚Äôve been great, but clearly there is no protection for patients being really hurt when a therapist on talkspace fails to uphold their professional duty and obligations.

,"I struggle with an anxiety disorder and depression. I needed to start speaking with someone quickly and thought this would be a good way to do so while finding a local therapist for tele-visits. 

For the cost of the service I could have had three actual therapy sessions. I heard from the therapist after the time the app told me I would and they explained that they have no control over how many patients they have so they cannot even begin to meet the deadlines set in the app. We‚Äôre talking about 100 people being assigned to a single therapist. No one can be expected to provide quality therapy to that many clients. 

Did some more online research and found out that therapists are barely getting paid so why would there be any incentive for them to answer messages let alone provide meaningful responses? So yes, I could switch therapists, but then a person who has done nothing wrong but can‚Äôt keep up with Talkspace‚Äôs ridiculous client numbers gets penalized and I would just get shifted to another therapist in the same boat. It‚Äôs not right for either of us. 

I wish I‚Äôd researched them more before signing up but I was in need of help and short on time. Now they have my money, don‚Äôt offer refunds and I‚Äôm at square one and facing the same issues I signed up to get help managing on my own.  $300+ dollars has given me some generic exercises easily found in any CBT/DBT workbook and an expensive digital journal and no actual therapy. 

I feel cheated out of my therapy budget for the month and will not continue with the service. If you are struggling with any diagnosed condition this is not a good place to seek assistance. While they claim that it‚Äôs less expensive than traditional therapy, it‚Äôs not and the value for the money is low for both patients and therapists.

First of all, they make you talk to something called a ‚ÄúMatching Agent‚Äù who isn‚Äôt the therapist. They talk to you about ‚ÄúWhat brings you to Talkspace?‚Äù This is completely wrong because it‚Äôs not the therapist. I was kind of tricked into opening up to this person. 

Rates are really bad. 
$65/week for JUST TEXTING. 
$260/month for JUST TEXTING. Oh, and a free 10 minute video session. I didn‚Äôt even look beyond this price point. 

Went with the $260. 

Then I picked ‚Äúmy‚Äù therapist. I typed to her and typed and typed. She never responded. Talkspace‚Äôs response to the FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION of ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt my therapist answering?‚Äù  was a pithy article about how ‚Äútherapists are humans too‚Äù and they‚Äôve got a lot of work to do, or something.

Instead of an actual solution,  Talkspace offers TWO options: 1) wait for a reply or 2) choose a different therapist.

I decided that I had spent WAY too much money to be ignored and wanted my money back. I submitted a request ticket stating that I hadn‚Äôt even gotten to use the services and I wanted my money back. They completely ignored my first service request. I ended up submitting 3 more service requests. Still ignored.  

Then, I went on Twitter. The ONLY WAY to get their attention was to get on Twitter and publicly decry them for stealing. I got a DM from whomever was running the Twitter and THEN AND ONLY THEN was I able to get my money back. I still haven‚Äôt actually gotten it back, it‚Äôs going to take 2-5 business days. 

Suffice it to say, they‚Äôre taking advantage of depressed people during a pandemic. The matching specialist never even offered up the fact that they accept insurance until AFTER  you‚Äôve already paid the money. Then, if you want to add your insurance card, that technically starts another ‚Äúaccount‚Äù, and both accounts will remain open AND auto renew unless you fix it and close the first one. It‚Äôs money.

,"I was thoroughly disappointed - I thought this would be perfect for me with a busy and irregular schedule. The one live session I scheduled was canceled by talk space because the therapist never confirmed it.

The few responses I did get from the therapist were so boiler plate generic that I'm positive everyone gets exactly the same response. I felt like the after thought obligation of someone trying to ""get their work done"" while running out the door to a party. I sent very thorough messages, waited a long time for a response, then the response was generic, so I elaborated even more and waited again for another generic response. Really no ""therapy"" happening. You could achieve the same therapeutic benefit by just writing in a journal - the responses you get will be just as useful. 

I set up therapy through a local clinic that offers in person or telemedicine. They take my insurance unlike Talkspace, scheduling is easy, and they do therapy live over face time. For the same $260 per month, I could literally have 26 hours of LIVE sessions with a highly trained therapist over face time, due to insurance copay. You'd be surprised how many places are offering similar telemedicine these days. Talk space live session is very short, and I can't speak to how effective it is since my session got canceled. The talk space model is not necessary any more, since most clinics are offering telemedicine due to covid. 

Talkspace only issued a partial refund after I had the service for less than 3 days, literally 4 very generic responses from the therapist, 1 canceled live session, and not responding to my support ticket for multiple days. I sent support an email and got an automatic response which thankfully had instructions for canceling and requesting a refund. Unfortunately the refund is calculated pro rata automatically and I'm waiting for a response from a human being. As of this moment, I'm still out $35.

First, it is very misleading when it says 24/7 chat. Some sort of chat therapy would be a really great thing to have, but that is not talkspace. They should openly say that you will only get one message a day from your provider 5 days a week. This is not what I expected.

The first week is all just about setting up your therapy, and with one message a day and multiple forms to get through, this goes at a snail's pace. It feels as though the therapist are trained to drag out the set up period for as long as possible. So the first week is essentially wasted, but you are still charged for it.

 The other thing which seems unethical about this app is it constantly threatens you that you'll lose your therapist and never be able to pick them again. I feel that if this were a legitimate mental health app and you could not afford a therapist for a couple of months that you should be able to get back your old therapist no matter how much time has gone by. Your issues are personal and therapy is meant to build on your relationship with a therapist.  

*Edit* To their credit the support team did refund me which I am very grateful for. 

I found my therapist online which seemed like he had his own practice, but when I messaged him saying that the Talkspace format was not going to work out for me and that I wanted regular therapy sessions, he said he was sorry and that he could only offer therapy through Talkspace.

,"I signed up for Talkspace at the beginning of November of 2020 after realizing I needed to seek counseling for my general anxiety and severe insecurity and social anxiety. Like most people who struggle with these things, particularly social anxiety, it took a great deal of courage to take the step to get help, especially because I had never been through therapy before due to cost and extreme hesitancy to reach out for professional help. This is something I mentioned repeatedly to my therapist and the matching representative throughout my brief time with Talkspace. 

I was assigned to a therapist named Lisa within a day or two of signing up with Talkspace. I was very open with my deep sense of imposter syndrome and social anxiety and though I wasn‚Äôt in immediate peril, it was really important for me to talk to someone so I could regain control of my life. It was going fine until I received a notification that my therapist would be on vacation until the end of December. At this point, it was around November 8, and I‚Äôd used Talkspace for less than a week. Neither Lisa nor Talkspace gave me any prior notification that she would be gone or gave me a substitute‚Äîor, assigned me to a therapist who didn‚Äôt have a month and a half vacation planned. Instead, the automated notification in my chat with Lisa said I was encouraged to keep sending messages to her so I could write down my feelings and she‚Äôd get back to me when she returned from vacation. Yes, Talkspace expected me to continue paying the fee for a MONTH AND A HALF while I message myself in an echo chamber. Especially as a person who struggles with self image and feeling valued by others‚Äîwhich, again, I made very clear to everyone at Talkspace I talked with‚Äîthis was a massive blow and completely undid what little therapy Lisa had provided me. 

I emailed Talkspace explaining the situation in detail, how horrible it made me feel, how irresponsible both Talkspace and Lisa were, and asking for a refund. I received a very sterile automated response telling me to fill out a form so I could get my refund, and everything I had written about my displeasure with my experience fell completely on deaf ears. I felt so insignificant, which was intensified by the fact that it was a therapy service that supposedly made counseling affordable, accessible, and empowering. It did none of those things for me.

,"I am thankful to my therapist for being responsive, and checking in at least once a day. He was also respectful and professional. I did get 1-2 nuggets of useful advice. However, I found the therapy lacking in many ways and ultimately unhelpful. I was hoping for insight into my situations, but most responses I got were very basic‚Äîeither easily googled or common sense. Still I was hopeful and wanted to give it a chance. I reiterated my goals with my therapist so he knew I wasn‚Äôt just here to vent, that I was looking for deeper understanding of what was going on. I continued to find the responses more of repetitions of what I said rather than anything I could learn from. I even tried nudging him in the right direction by suggesting possible explanations I learned from my own reading, hoping he would delve deeper. In response my therapist would agree with me and give a one sentence ‚Äúelaboration.‚Äù I felt he was just trying to keep me happy and ‚Äúfeeling heard,‚Äù but I couldn‚Äôt get much depth or new information from him. He honestly seemed to be trying his best but either through lack of skill/knowledge or the format‚Äôs limitations, this therapy did not deliver. After a few weeks I found that answering the messages felt like a chore. I responded to the therapist just to get it off my to do list. I wasn‚Äôt getting anything useful from it.

 

Btw, I was a little put off that I had to include an emergency contact‚Äôs full name and phone number. I had hoped for some anonymity due to the personal nature of things I would talk about. I tried to give just a first name, but he would not continue without a first AND last name, and phone number. 

Overall, from my experience I don‚Äôt think this format of therapy is going to help people looking for real therapy. The delay in response time (which to be fair, they warn you about) and that it‚Äôs written, makes it hard to connect or get deeper. Not sure who this would work for?

I‚Äôm a very straightforward person. I told my backstory, how that effects me, and how I‚Äôd like to improve, and what type of things I expected from therapy/needed.

The first therapist was an okay person, but bad therapist.. He literally compared every ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of mine to a bigger problem he had once in his life. He provided no coping mechanisms. And talked like a fortune cookie. No help whatsoever. He made life sound like a sad existence that you just have to get used to... No Thanks!!

Second therapist was a young woman who just sounded really cocky after we actually talked. Like she knew everything and how to fix everything. But didn‚Äôt actually try to ‚Äúfix‚Äù anything. And basically belittled me and told me what I thought was wrong and sent a passive aggressive message ‚Äúproving‚Äù me wrong. 

Third one seemed like she would have been actually helpful. Helped me learn a breathing technique right away. But we didn‚Äôt really talk as much as I hoped we could. And by this point, I wasn‚Äôt really willing to waste more time and money on this app. 

As I was trying to cancel my subscription they kept offering me cheaper and cheaper deals and plans. Not sure if it was because they actually want to provide help to less fortunate people, or because they want any and all money they can get...

Either way, it would be nice if they could screen their employees before letting them actually see patients. People deserve great mental health care and I‚Äôve seen a couple subpar therapists right off the bat. Real therapy can and should help you. And it shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to find a good therapist.

After a week of having that therapist she took a break without telling me and I couldn‚Äôt wait a week when I just got started so I switched. My new therapist was great in the beginning she responded fast and  short it was like someone was actually listening to me and it wasn‚Äôt a robot. But to be honest she wasn‚Äôt the best sometimes she would only listen to half of  what I said. These past 2 weeks have really convinced me to delete this app after telling her about my past she left me on read for 4 days finally she responded ignoring my message and told me to talk about my trauma. I told her more of my past and she left me on read once again then 2 days later the app told me she was taking a 11 day break.

I finally decided to try Talkspace because it‚Äôs advertised on The Read and I wanted to use their code. I should‚Äôve trusted my gut when I signed up and it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to use my own promo code. 

I signed up 6/1/22 and was matched to a provider the same day. I booked an appointment with her and got a message later telling me she was unavailable at that time (I chose it from a calendar showing she was available; another red flag). We went back and forth a couple times and found no coordination in our schedules, so I tried to match with another provider. I got a message stating they couldn‚Äôt match me and to click a button that would take me to a matching agent. The matching agent appears to be a bot and sent a message that day saying to check back tomorrow for a provider. Lol never got one. I sent several messages asking to be matched or to get me to someone to help. According to the read receipts they saw all my messages but never responded. 

I submitted a ticket through the app explaining the situation and asking for help or to be refunded. No response. My account was stuck in limbo not letting me request a new provider or anything. Today I cancelled my renewal and once I did that clicked something saying ‚Äúneed more help?‚Äù. That allowed me to request a refund, but of course it‚Äôs a prorated refund because it‚Äôs been a week that I‚Äôve have the subscription. Even though I‚Äôve had NO SESSIONS and am not even matched. 

This was the worst outcome for simply seeking help. I would never recommend Talkspace to anyone. I just want a full refund, to speak with a real human.

Perhaps it‚Äôs due to COVID and the sheer numbers of people requiring therapy, but my first therapist started off decent (although she mainly shared YouTube links on mindfulness - I kid you not) then turned the tables and dumped all of her work and personal life struggles on me. This is not what a client wants to hear when seeking an avenue to work through his or her own stuff. Therefore, I switched therapists, had to share all of my issues a second time (not sure why he couldn‚Äôt simply read the chat record), and he never responded once in two weeks after stating that he would once a day. I canceled my subscription but they really should be reimbursing me for the three months. I would not recommend this service to anyone. Lesson learned.

 The second time was when I saw refer a friend link from a YouTube video and when I resigned up, I was greeted by another lady who pretended to want to know how I feel and then pushed plans in my face. 

I was kinda turned off only because after why I wanted help and the steps I took and how it was my first time and that I honestly didn‚Äôt know what I wanted or got myself into she just didn‚Äôt care and pushed a plan at me once again.

The session should say the date and time along with how far away it is. Again, a screenshot would help 3. The app should not be crashing again and again.

2. I then proceeded to tell the therapist: i cry every other night over my break up only for her to ask me: and how does the breakup make you feel. Guess?
3.

After using the Wysa app, I discovered the main ‚Äútherapist‚Äù you speak with who helps guid you through your troubles is in fact an ai text bot, who sends scripted messages depending on key words you said, or the issues you selected. Sure, it responds accordingly to the key words but almost always gave me incoherent responses. It prompted that I add a real flesh and bone therapist to the chat, and apparently that costs money! Advertised at $179 quarterly! (Which they say boils down to $14.99 a month) and all that is for infinite texts, but only two calls a week! And after some math, I found out that their ‚Äú$14.99 a month‚Äù does NOT in fact add to a quarterly total of $179 like advertised, but instead $194.87!!thats almost $800 a year!! If you think free AI text bots will solve your problems, go ahead, but I implore that you avoid purchasing the real therapist sessions and ultimately losing money",GodricTheTurtle,Thoroughly disappointed,2,False,2020-05-17 14:17:34,wysa-mental-health-support,1166585565
,"I agree with some other commenters that this app‚Äôs approach is not for everyone. It is extremely scripted, and it can be frustrating and even demoralizing if your needs don‚Äôt fit into the script.  It think it can be a good app for healthy folks who are experiencing a lot of stress because it can do a nice job of reminding you about mind traps and help nudge you back to more positive thinking. And I‚Äôm sure some people like its corny humor, but I find it childish and annoying. In addition, if you are seriously depressed, take care. Seek help from a good therapist. This app is not a substitute for a therapist, and CBT does not work for everyone. In my case, when I was in the throes of depression, CBT actually backfired. It made me feel a 100 times worse. It can be miserable to try to recast negative thoughts into more positive thoughts when you can‚Äôt think of anything positive at all. My highly regarded CBT therapist recognized this and, thankfully, referred me to a skilled therapist with a more psychodynamic/eclectic approach. I will always be grateful to him for that.  Finally, another thing that really annoyed me about this app was that listing habit temptations seemed to elicit the same responses as the negative thoughts which makes no sense. Temptations are persuasive not negative. E.g. One of my temptations is ‚ÄúChips and candy taste so good.‚Äù, but Woebot asked if I could recast it into a more positive statement.

I emailed back and forth with customer service to ask what a care counselor does and I could not get a straight answer so I assumed it would be some type of clinician/ LCSW that I would have therapy with instead of a psychologist or something. No. You get a 30 minute appointment with a prescriber every 3 months that prescribes your medicine. I was told if you want more  appointments than every 3 months it‚Äôs extra. They are not your therapist. The care counselor IS ALSO NOT A THERAPIST. I was told this by my care counselor during my first appointment, he wanted to make it explicitly clear that he was not providing therapy. At most you tell them a problem you are having and they send you an article to read to help yourself. You will not be receiving any actual therapy from this package.

I do have to say the prescriber was so nice and knowledgeable, but the negative experience with them was probably just a product of the inconsistent service with this company. The medication wasn‚Äôt entered, so I tried to reach out to support through the app to inquire. After no response in the app, I called the contact number for support only to be prompted by recordings to seek assistance through the app. I‚Äôm given the vibe that representatives shouldn‚Äôt be bothered by phone. I felt completely lost in the process, and the portal is void of clearly set expectations for new patients. Only at the time of sending my cancellation email did I receive a response through the app and a voicemail.

,"I initially turned to cerebral when I needed therapy desperately, and struggled to find a therapist/psychiatrist in person who would take on new clients due to covid. I decided to go through with the subscription on here only to find out they had no available counselors and could only help me with getting medication. I proceeded with the mindset that I now only needed to look for a new therapist and could scratch a psychiatrist off the list. Terrible choice. Within the few months I've had cerebral, I've been forced to reschedule appointments with my prescriber THREE times already, and the only explanation I was provided with was ""Unforseen circumstances"". Normally I would be understanding of this, but three times is just unbelievable! Especially considering that due to this, I could not get a refill for my prescription before it ran out and went practically a week without my meds after only being on it for a month. Not to mention that your only source of communication through the app is a chat feature that could take anywhere up to 2 days to respond, and you can't even schedule an appointment until the notification pops up promoting you to do so. So if you feel you need an appointment quickly, good luck making one. I would say to anybody, take your money elsewhere and save yourself the headache. For an app that is meant to help people and provide somewhat of a safe space, they've really offered nothing but more frustration for me.",Brianna xcv,Frustrating service,1,False,2021-11-07 17:00:24,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

I was more asked what do I want instead of determined what I need. 

When I got to my first appointment with the counselor she called me instead of doing a video call. This was incredibly uncomfortable and I felt I in no way could find connection like this with the counselor. The meeting in general felt stale and scripted like she was reading off one question after the other.

You have to email them for one guy to email you to send a link to a form asking why you‚Äôre cancelling in different ways, then you email him back to wait for someone else to get back to you and try to convince you not to cancel for a discount ( instead of offering discounts automatically maybe you should determine why people are cancelling so much that you have to offer them!),

- Initial process, first visit, and prescription handling were straightforward

Cons:

- Within a week of onboarding, both the prescriber and the care coordinator dropped from the platform - leaving me in a state of limbo. This is a major issue for a platform developing around mental health.

- Canceling a plan is a hassle. They require submission of an email form, and actual cancelation may cause you to be charged erroneously. Adding friction to cancelation is a cheap trick used by subscription services to ‚Äúreduce churn‚Äù. It often backfires in the long run.

- It‚Äôs not possible to view providers without changing to a plan that supports the type of provider you‚Äôre trying to find. For example, you‚Äôd need a plan including Therapy to search for therapists. If you can‚Äôt find a good match, you have to submit a refund request given they already charged you.

Because they charged me for my second month then when I went to cancel they couldn‚Äôt send my meds. I get it. It‚Äôs sketchy to send meds when you‚Äôre not paying for the service but the thing was I paid for the month. The customer service rep I spoke to didn‚Äôt say anything about canceling causing medicine to not be delivered. I was also seeing my doctor for the meds so it wasn‚Äôt like I wasn‚Äôt seeing ANYONE for it. 

No refund. No meds. Nothing. Just money out the door and hey, gotta do what you gotta do. At this point, it‚Äôs blatantly obvious that the company does not care for mentally I‚Äôll people, which is a shame because this was the recommended app for me. 

Maybe communication amongst your subscribers would be best. At this point I can‚Äôt say how much I spent that I didn‚Äôt get back because it‚Äôs been a hot minute since using cerebral. Not a day goes by that I don‚Äôt miss it.

It took two weeks before they allowed me to make an appointment‚Ä¶ for a week later.

Never mind that I completed my profile in excruciating detail. The therapist never even read any of it.

I spent 4 months with Cerebral and that is as many months as I now behind in getting treatment. After joining, it was almost a month until I could meet with a prescriber. (You know the whole thing they advertise against.) During my first session, my prescriber spoke with me for 15 minutes and prescribed a generic catch-all medication. Admittedly, I was actually alarmed by how much of a standard thing that seemed. There was no consideration of my medical history or my individual symptoms. After 6 weeks without improvement, my second appointment was a 10 minute follow up, where just as quickly, that medication was dropped and a new one was prescribed. I was told if that didn‚Äôt work, we would try a more traditional ADHD treatment. A follow up was set for 4 weeks. Within the first, I became depressive and borderline suicidal. I have never suffered from depression until that medication. When I finally got my follow up and informed him of my response to the medication I was told sorry, and that there was ‚Äúnothing more they could do for me.‚Äù After nearly 4 months, I was right back to where I had started. For counseling, I was allowed one 30 minute session each month. While not entirely unhelpful (my counselor is the only reason for a second star), 30 minutes a month is simply not ample to actually address serious issues. I have wasted time, wasted money, and wasted potential opportunities for growth. Cerebral is nothing more than a quick-cash pyramid scheme. There is just something not quite right under the exterior, and I would imagine the current DOJ and DEA investigations will not be the last into Cerebral. Please learn from my mistake.

I started over with them, and things went well, until once again, I was inexplicably reassigned. I only had one appointment with this new provider before I was once AGAIN reassigned. I‚Äôm sick of having to go over everything with a new person every single time, just to get a refill for a medication I‚Äôve been successfully on for the past four+ years now. Also, keep in mind that when you tell them you want to cancel your plan, they immediately suspend any refills for your medication. Meaning, even if you have 1 or 2 refills left that you could otherwise get from the pharmacy, they essentially revoke authorization so you‚Äôre unable to get your meds. Absolutely irresponsible and a sorry excuse for ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù. I‚Äôve had to pay for an extra month I didn‚Äôt want with this service just to allow myself time to find another provider without lapsing on my meds. Going off of psychiatric medication cold turkey is, at best, extremely unpleasant, not to mention dangerous! For a service that claims to care about its patients, you sure do abandon that quickly once they decide to stop paying you. I wouldn‚Äôt wish medication withdrawal on my worst enemy, and you should be ashamed that you essentially hold this over people‚Äôs heads just to get them to stay with your service. No wonder so many providers are ‚Äúmoving on from Cerebral‚Äù. Also, why even offer an option for insurance if you‚Äôre not even going to take it? I had two different insurance plans while I was with Cerebral, and neither one was accepted despite being large, nationwide companies. The tens of dollars a month I might be saving versus my copay for an in-person appointment is nowhere near the headache and frustration this service has put me through.

Their system doesn't work, their prescriber and ""care"" team certainly doesn't care, they have non-existent support, they literally leave you to do and figure everything out for yourself.

The first response I get is how they have up to 24 hours to respond to requests - right, that's my bad, I'll try to not have issues getting my anti-anxiety and depression medication filled for the very first time.  The cherry on top is that I tried to cancel the first time, and they said I had to email a cancel line (this is a stupid and predatory customer solutions tactic) and I didn't get a response.  Then when they finally added the functionality to their TERRIBLE app, I cancelled on the app (after they charged me that $85 bucks they certainly love) - the only problem is, right after I cancelled (after already paying) they cut off my access to my account AND to the app.  I couldn't access anything at all, and I had JUST paid for a new month just 3 days prior (confirmed to me by their idiotic support line).

I was very wrong. I gave it a shot for a long time but I should have given up a long time ago. No one on their staff communicates with each other and if you need anything to be done quickly such as speaking to your prescriber due to a bad reaction to a medication or an issue with an appointment or an issue with being charged twice the amount you should be for medication, you will not receive any help.

I now just tried to cancel my membership before it was renewed since my prescriber appointment was canceled by Cerebral 2 weeks in a row making a lapse in my medication. Instead of canceling my membership when I asked them to, they charged me for a full month for my renewal and then deactivated my account the day after. I spent all day trying to speak with someone from support to get a refund and the only option they gave me was to void the cancellation and stick it out for the month I already paid for. I finally gave in and let them do this, making an appointment with a new prescriber I have never seen before just so I could get medication refilled since I was ignored by the other prescriber. Now a day later I got a new email from a different person from support who canceled my membership AGAIN and I have now lost the new appointment as well.

I was to meet with her again in a month to determine if I need to keep it or try something different. I had already decided it wasn't for me. * Cerebral says you can text with your therapist. Not exactly. You are assigned case workers. You message them and they pass your message on to your counselor. So don't tell them anything too confidential. * I informed them I wished to cancel my service before the first month ended for reasons not pertaining to Cerebral. They recommend making such requests a week before month's end to ensure you don't get charged for the next month. * An hour before my last appointment with my councilor I received several emails.

,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I had one appointment with my ‚Äúcare‚Äù provider, and it was the most uncomfortable experience I‚Äôve ever had with a doctor. She was slouched back, with RBF on the whole time. She seemed annoyed and angry. She also didn‚Äôt look at me once. I started using this program so I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay $200 a visit to see a local doctor, it had 5 stars‚Ä¶. So I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. I regret it. I have crippling anxiety, and this appointment gave me nothing but that. And I was forced to sit through it for an hour. I explained to her that my current treatment of almost 2 years was keeping me out of the hospital. And she told me she didn‚Äôt think it was working (though I haven‚Äôt found myself in a hospital gown since starting) she stated she would prescribe my current medication as a courtesy. I asked her twice to contact my prior provider so she can get some background as to where I was prior to treatment, and where I am now. She declined. That night I had my first panic attack in weeks. And one of the worst ones I‚Äôve had in awhile. I took my last emergency medication, as she said she sent over the other prescription.

Medication has never worked for me. Usually if I bad thoughts they are easy to switch around. Not this time the medication they put me on I couldnt even hear myself anymore. The positive me that is.

Turns out they even took my money which they don‚Äôt deserve at all. I wrote and email asking them for it back I received nothing. I am so tried of people walking all over me. I will give them today.

Im starting to wonder even these guys are even professionals because they dont act like it. 

So it was fine the first session? I can‚Äôt remember if I did a second. I do know my last session I was anxious about life events and REALLY needed to talk about them but kept getting cut off. I was told I could have a new appointment with someone tomorrow, and there was nothing available and all day I haven‚Äôt heard a thing back.

,"ü•∞To be clear, the doctors and customer service is amazing! ü•∞
But the app is a confusing mess. My problem is with the links at the bottom of the page. The first link messages takes you to a screen with a typing box. It has no way of choosing who on your ‚Äúccc‚Äù team you message. Also, it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to figure out who is who. They have made up 2 titles for the people on my team. Cerebral Care Counselor and Cerebral Care Coordinator. Someone has a thing for alliteration, but these titles aren‚Äôt established anywhere else and seem randomly designated. The Counselor is the person you talk to about meds. The Coordinator is person who literally counsels you. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è To top it off, the titles are so long that on the only screen you can type on you only see the first 6 example letters of each doctors name ‚ÄúRichar‚Ä¶‚Äù with ‚ÄúCerebral C‚Ä¶‚Äù to distinguish who is who. Unacceptable. Then there‚Äôs the Appointment‚Äôs link. At the top of the page says in faded letters ‚ÄúSchedule Appointments‚Äù but it‚Äôs not a link it‚Äôs just literally faded letters on a screen. Below that is ‚ÄúComplete Monthly Self-Assessment‚Äù with a start button. Which takes you to a 33 question test. Each question is on a separate screen. Each time you answer a question it takes you to the next screen, but you have to manually scroll up every page to see the question being asked. It‚Äôs cumbersome, and needlessly time consuming. Ironically, you‚Äôre being asked about how hard it is for you to finish repetitive tasks. It also looks like if you answer all these repetitive question (33!!!) you might be taken to a screen where you can schedule an appointment. Imagine the frustration of taking a 33 question self assessment when all you want to do is schedule your next appointment only to find that the assessment has nothing to do with making an appointment. To be fair, I am autistic with PTSD and ADHD. But to be BLUNT AS FOOK, I am exactly the type of person this program was made for. The accompanying app should be more sensitive to its clientele. It should have the most intuitive interface possible. It should be designed to be navigable when under extreme stress or when having a bad reaction to new medication. As it is, they have a panic button, but it doesn‚Äôt explain what that means. I was afraid it would alert authorities which is the worst thing to do in most situations if you are Atypical and a minority. However, I did just use it now to see what it was, sure that I was calm enough to handle police if it comes to that. But it turns out it‚Äôs just a series of overly long typed out calming tasks. Who can read paragraphs when having a panic attack? It‚Äôs useless. At the least they should have a Siri type talk you through it. Gods, even banks let you feel like you‚Äôre talking to a person when trying to reach a human. To be clear, I love my doctors.

The app isn‚Äôt cheap either. For how much they charge people their communication should be way better. They‚Äôre helping people who take their mental health serious and instead they‚Äôre creating additional frustration AND stealing money. This app is a total scam.

I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed!! I‚Äôve been struggling mentally and I wanted to try something new. I signed up for the care counselor and medication. Our sessions were only 30min each. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I needed medication but I was open to it if I really needed it. In my opinion, 30min is NOT enough to provide enough medical evidence for medication after only 1 session. It just seems like they‚Äôre throwing medications here and there and I‚ÄôM not okay with that. I already have digestive issues from previous medications so I‚Äôm mindful of what I put in my body. I was under the impression that they wouldn‚Äôt consider prescribing any medications until after a few sessions not after the 1st one! I do want to say that the care counselor was amazing and provided great info. But again 30min was just not enough! I would recommend actually seeing a therapist and ruling out any other health issues before taking any medication.

It‚Äôs a complete and total SCAM! I paid over $300 and talked to a prescriber on a Sunday that told me she couldn‚Äôt help me and that someone else would reach out to me within the next day or two. Three days go by and I reached out to Support‚Ä¶these are the emails that followed: Wednesday: Hello, I had a session with prescriber Michelle on Sunday and she said someone would be reaching out to me to schedule a follow up by Tuesday, but it‚Äôs Wednesday and I haven‚Äôt heard anything yet. Is it possible to schedule that here? Thanks, Justin S. Thursday: Hi Judith, (They couldn‚Äôt even get my name right from an email) Good day! You just had the visit 4 days ago. It usually takes 3 months before a client receives a notification for a follow up visit. Best, Julius D Thursday evening: Hi Julius, First, my name is Justin, not Judith. Secondly, the prescriber said she wanted a second opinion regarding bipolar disorder.   You‚Äôre telling me this second opinion takes 3 months and I‚Äôm to pay $900 in the meantime before even being prescribed medication? If that‚Äôs the case, where may I find information on cancelling your services? This has been a momentous waste of my time and money. I‚Äôm very happy to share my experience with other people as needed as well. Your asking me to pay nearly $1000 to wait for nothing, and it‚Äôs a scam. Finally, it doesn‚Äôt matter if I just had a visit 4 days ago or 4 minutes ago, you should at least take the time to look into my concern because I genuinely hope this is just an oversight due to laziness on your part to not just simply look into it. So, for the second time: I was supposed to receive a call Monday or Tuesday to schedule the visit with that second prescriber to discuss bipolar disorder and I haven‚Äôt been able to schedule it. Are you going to look into it and have them reach back out or give me the resources to get in touch with that person, or are you not? Michelle didn‚Äôt say 3 months, she said two days and I‚Äôm on day four now‚Ä¶ Thanks, Justin S Friday: Hi Justin, Good day! I do apologize. I'm terrible with names. I'm sorry to hear that you've decided to discontinue receiving mental health services from Cerebral. In order to move forward with the cancellation process, please fill out the following form. Once you have filled it out, kindly wait for the cancellation team to contact you regarding cancellation or any other requests.

Upon completion, you can expect a member of our Coordination team to be in touch with you regarding the status of your request.

There ADS say they offer ADHD SPECIALISTS and I spoke to a provider that is far away from being a specialist from ADHD, did not want to listen to what I had to say, misdiagnosed me, and did not provide me with NO MEDICATION (Remember, there services say that there packages come with PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDE MEDICATION THAT IS WHAT IM PAYING FOR) but NO medication was given to me, she even said that Stimulants are like COCAINE, which is misinforming and hurtful to say adhd medication is like a drug, it creates STIGMA. I told her I still believed it was adhd and she just brushed it off and said ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs something you need to speak to your counselor about‚Äù.

I have been using cerebral for about three months and every month I have had an issue. 
The biggest thing is that I have never been able to schedule all of my appointments each month due to lack of availability on their end the fact that they can only schedule one appointment at a time. The first month I signed up out of desperation, I really needed some help, but when I signed up and paid I found out that the only available therapist wasn‚Äôt available until the next billing cycle. I asked customer service if I could just withhold payment until the next billing cycle so I could pay when services could be provided. The response was a simple ‚Äúno refunds‚Äù kind of response without offering any kind of productive help for the situation so I was rightfully angry and ready to cancel my credit card. Luckily I talked to another representative the next day who helped but was only able to find someone who was available halfway through the billing cycle so I paid full price for half the service but half service is better than no service and I really needed the help. And honestly, if you are struggling, there‚Äôs just no room left in your brain to deal with this kind of issue. Each month there has been an issue and I‚Äôm experiencing a similar issue upon cancelling the service now. 

So in summary:

This service is only good for the staff they have actually caring for you. To them, I‚Äôm very thankful. However, the company policies of offering zero flexibility financially when they themselves cannot provide their services to you seems highly parasitic and the lack of helpful trained customer service is staggering and will leave you wondering if they even listen. It‚Äôs not worth the hassle. The experience is worth it if you can get the service you need but you will not know what kind of availability there is until you‚Äôve already paid and everything is scheduled on a rolling schedule so there‚Äôs never a guarantee of service. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not always like this but it seems fairly common from the reviews I‚Äôve read after the fact so if you decide to use this company, ask yourself if you are willing to handle this possibility first.",Pepeleatinkbug,"Good therapists and doctors, terrible company",2,False,2022-04-27 13:53:24,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

,"There are a lot of bugs with this app and usability flaws. 

Particular ones that bug me include:

Going to look at settings will result in receiving two emails stating confirmation of setting changes (when no changes were made). 

When choosing a care counselor I clicked on a picture to see if I could learn more about them and it selected them as my counselor with no way to go back or change my selection. I emailed customer service and they said I should be able to change them but tried in browser and app and couldn‚Äôt and asked them to tell me how and they ended up just telling me to email them if I want to change my counselor. But how would I even know who I want to change to? 

Odd ones include email confirmations of invoice numbers that didn‚Äôt include the number.

My app also shows I was charged for an upgrade I cancelled but customer service says they show they don‚Äôt have that charge.

Also it has been almost 2 weeks since my prescriber appointment and it took almost a week of my app saying prescription approved before I reached out to ask for an ETA that the coordinator told me my prescription was rejected by insurance.  I decided to go out of pocket and they put in one prescription and forgot the other. Then that prescription got filled finally and the other one has been waiting for the prescriber to get back to the pharmacist for some sort of confirmation.

However, the service and response time has gotten awful. When they changed my dose my medication price doubled without warning. I have OptumRx prescription insurance and have requested that they transfer my prescription since my medication would cost a third of what i‚Äôm currently
paying. It‚Äôs been nearly a month since my request. They responded saying they would get back to me. Exactly 10 days later I still hadn‚Äôt heard from them so I gave them a nudge. Same response, they‚Äôll get back to me. I told them i was nearly out of medication and asked that they refill my prescriptions once more while I wait for the transfer since I was almost out of pills.

The upside: 

1 - the prescribers are fantastic. They listen to you and work with you to develop a treatment plan for the short term along with long term goals and/or long term contingency plans. For the first time in my life I was treated with care and understanding for my conditions and issues. Those with mental health issues certainly know the treatment they receive when seeking help from typical medical professionals. 

2 - the ‚Äúidea‚Äù of this service is fantastic. The idea that you have a faster track to your prescribers and the fact that they are able to send medication directly to your home removes the extremely strenuous challenges that those attempting to obtain typical mental health medication experience. 

The downside: 

1 - the first contradicts my upside point #2. The problem is it is just that ‚Ä¶.an ‚Äúidea‚Äù. The execution of this idea is what is lacking. You have a dedicated customer service agent that provides direct fast access to your prescriber and is also responsible for ensure your prescriptions are filled and sent as well as billing and insurance questions. The issue is that the service you receive is fantastic, when you receive it. They ask that you use a messaging system to communicate with your rep. You will be lucky to get a response once per day. If they do not answer your questions in full, you will need to wait until the next day for clarification or another response. 

2 - the timeliness of delivering your medications. Those of you would need a treatment plan that includes a medication know how important consistency is when it comes to your mental health. They simply cannot figure out how avoid issues that interrupt your schedule with medications. It is almost normal practice that I am without my medication for 7-10 days each month. This is disappointing considering I pay a premium, out of pocket, to receive my medication directly from them (or their pharmacy, etc). On top of that, I have to be the one to proactively work to find out why my medication did not ship, when it will ship and to make matters worse there is zero increased urgency in this situations. 

So you will pay a premium for your prescriptions, they will be severely late to arrive and you will have to track all of this down on your own and you have to expect to do all this working off of maybe one response from your care rep each day. This is on top of the monthly fee you pay to have this service (besides the expensive cost of the medications).",M4543gbcrn,Great Potential But Falls Short,2,False,2022-01-12 13:57:41,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

First off the pros:

The Care Coordinators are responsive, however they dont know much, this is to be expected as they seem to not have access to much when it comes to the actual customer.

You can get medication quite easily. If you know what you need (previous diagnosis) they make it easy. 

Thats it.

Now the Cons:

Care Counselor conversations are incredibly transactional. This person is not someone that has an educational background in Psychology it seems, but more so a box checker- ‚ÄúDo you have feelings of ____ if so you can take ___‚Äù over 6 months I had a total of 30 minutes spent with my counselor.

Because of the lack of personalizations and frankly lack of true care I was experiencing, i decided to cancel my subscription. 

Now heres where it gets fun. The cancellation process is GRUELING. They truly are aiming at making you not cancel and it feels very gaslighty. The team is not very responsive at all. Oh and I cancelled March 10th and they charged me for my April ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù. 

Its very apparent that Cerebral is more focused on making their money than caring about their customer base. The company seems so promising until you experience the lack of care that should be present in a company that is dealing with people that need help and are looking for help.

If I was in dire need and this was my first experience trying to get help I would be concerned for myself.

,"The service is a good means to an end, it offers access to treatments for a set of mental health conditions that make it particularly difficult to access care ‚Äî multi-month waits for appointments, the stress of in-person visits, etc. This eliminates a lot of the burden felt by those suffering from executive dysfunction.

Massive concerns almost everywhere else. I am currently on day 7 of what is looking to be 9 days total of clerical hassle trying to get my prescription to be affordable ‚Äî they first prescribed a brand name medication that my insurance would not cover, and also mishandled the prior authorization process so my insurer wasn‚Äôt properly contacted. 

Additionally, when prompted to schedule my next visit with my prescribing physician, I can see that she has zero availability for the next three months. From what i understand, I am to start a medication this month which requires more frequent visits than that in order to keep having access to. 

To make all of this worse, communication there is abysmal ‚Äî the responses via messages in the app are not as prompt as advertised. I have spoken to two people there on the phone (which is it‚Äôs own accomplishment ‚Äî the phone tree there makes this extremely difficult to access as it just tries to redirect you to use the app for all but one set of choices) and it is abundantly clear that you need a phone conversation to get quality correspondence out of them.

I think this all amounts to playing a dangerous game when they are prescribing medications that are habit-forming, like amphetamines, or which are outright dangerous to stop cold turkey, like many SSRIs. If they cannot provide reliable assistance for their patients it will lead to avoidable gaps in medication. This kind of sloppy, disorganized conduct will end up causing the very patients they set out to help to suffer unnecessary withdrawal symptoms.

I might still encourage people to use this as a way to kickstart their mental healthcare, but only as a stepping stone. My next priority is to transition my care into a local doctor‚Äôs office where I might actually feel like I have advocates. I would strongly recommend only using this service as that sort of stopgap, as there are some glaring red flags regarding communication and reliability that make it look like a bad long-term plan.",mjgeis,Slow to respond and less organized than you should want,2,False,2021-10-04 20:01:30,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

The first claim they did not meet is being affordable and accepting of my insurance. I submitted my insurance information and was only told the prices after insurance coverage. Turns out my insurance doesn‚Äôt work with cerebral so I was charged the full amount, $325, without being notified ahead of time. I do not think $325 monthly fee is affordable by any means. 

The second claim is that you would be able to speak with your therapist on a weekly basis. My first two sessions were about two weeks apart. Then after weeks of calendar confusion, on the therapists part, I finally got an appointment with my therapist who told me he is overwhelmed with the amount of patients he is getting on top of his private practice. He said it was unethical because he couldn‚Äôt effectively have therapeutic sessions and his wait time was a month and a half out! He wound up leaving cerebral after weeks of not being able to schedule him. 

The third claim is that you would be able to see a provider when ever you need. My provider would cancel on me four or more times regularly. I was prescribed a medication that needed a follow up and was not able to get that on time. My prescription was increased and I had very bad reactions to it, life altering reactions, but could not get an appointment with my provider so I stopped taking them cold turkey which is not recommended and was a horrible experience. 

The forth claim is that you could message your provider and therapist at any time. This is completely untrue. You have a team coordinator who can transfer the message over but doesn‚Äôt or maybe does but you never hear back from your therapist or provider.

I have contacted their support team 7 times asking for a refund for the last two months where I had zero services provided but charged a whopping $325 monthly!! Every time I get the same response about cancelling on the app. They completely disregard the content of my emails and send the exact same response. I should be refunded for my entire experience because I never received the services that were promised. I also had two months of horrible reactions to the medication I was given and horrible reactions getting off of the medication. I was unable to work or leave my house for almost two months! Save your time and money and find a therapist and provider in your area that will actually be able to see you effectively. 

It seems like cerebral bit off way more than they could chew and then ignore you when you‚Äôve had enough of them not fulfilling their promised obligations.

My team said they msged support, I sent emails to support, no response.

After a year being on the app I had to start relying in my care team to make my appointments. Sometimes random people would come into the chat to ‚Äòhelp me‚Äô only for the next random person to not read the chat and have to start conversations all over again. Sometimes this would go on for weeks and I‚Äôd pay for a month where I got no appointments.

The last straw was when my prescribed was promoted. I made an appointment with the new prescriber given to me and it was canclled 20 minutes before the appointment. Then I was told my new prescriber, the one just given to me that I needed to update my expiring prescription, was booked solid for 6 months. The random care team ‚Äòhelper‚Äô offered to help me find a new prescriber. When I said sure, the next two days had a new random team member, not reading what was previously said and telling me I needed to make an appointment. With a provider who didn‚Äôt have an availability for 6 months.

A real lack of communication and me paying all the while for no service or appointments. I unsubscribed from the service.

Since unsubscribing I have gotten the same ‚ÄúYou cancelled you service email, 20 times. Sometimes 3 or four in a 5 minute period. I tried to msg them about the issue, but only got an automated response.

I‚Äôve also been charged for my medication 3 times. On the 6th, 9th and 15th. When I finally got on the website to msg my care team, (because the app no longer works after you cancel) I was greeted by another random care team person, who told me to email an address I had been emailing for months about my appointment issue with no response.

Up front this app seems great. I had one year of happiness. But the management of clients and employees is horrible. Once one thing changes the whole system crumbles.

I was initially diagnosed with severe anxiety and moderate depression (which is accurate, as I was previously seeing a doctor with the same diagnosis). I like how convenient Cerebral is and both my prescriber & care counselor are very nice and supportive. It‚Äôs also very affordable for people who do not have insurance. 

However, there are two huge cons for me. The first major con being the lapse in medication. I have 2 medications; one I have to take consistently on a daily basis with no lapse between doses or withdrawal symptoms can occur, and the other medication is one I take as needed when my anxiety is especially high. Currently, my daily medication runs out in 2 days, yet my refill has not been mailed out yet. Every time I try contacting someone to see where my medication is, I get no response. I‚Äôm truly worried about having no medication in 2 days and worried about what withdrawal symptoms I may experience because of it. This is a huge problem. My medications have always shipped on the 9th of the month, but it‚Äôs now the 10th and no shipment. Very unprofessional and concerning. 

My second concern is the absolute lack of communication between the prescriber and care counselor. For example, my appointment with my prescriber 4 weeks ago, she informed me that both of my medications would now be mailed to me (previously only 1 was mailed and the other was sent to my local pharmacy) and she said my medications would ship early (July 28th instead of August 9th), because she increased the dose of one medication and wanted that to get to me asap. However, my care counselor wasn‚Äôt aware of any of this and told me my medication would not be shipped on the 28th and she didn‚Äôt see anything that noted my 2nd medication now being shipped. As a patient, this is very frustrating, especially since you can only communicate regularly with the care counselor, but not the prescriber. Also frustrating as I was told my medications would ship early on July 28th, yet here I am on August 10th and neither of my medications have shipped. Even communication between my care counselor and myself has seemed to decrease and I‚Äôm not sure why. 

Initially, this started out as a great way to seek help for anxiety and depression, but now it‚Äôs spiraling into a nightmare. I really hope they improve their consistency in shipping medications as well as their communication, because I believe this has the potential to be a terrific tool for people with mental health disorders, but for now, I‚Äôd say avoid Cerebral as it will only increase anxiety.",Missmikmik,Not ideal,2,False,2021-08-10 16:36:00,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

I have experience with licensed therapists and have seen several in the past.  I saw an ad for this service and figured I would give it a go.

If you have gone to therapy before, you know that it can be an exhausting experience and one that you sometimes need to mentally prepare for.  My experience with this app left me feeling worse than I did when I tried getting back into my journey.  

At first, things seemed ok. You go through and come plate a profile that asks for personal information and even attempts to try and help to see if health insurance can help cover - which was appreciated.  However, once I input my information in I was only offered one care counselor to choose from.  I even attempted to go back and remove specific things I was struggling with in hopes of getting an array of counselors to try and see who I would connect best with.  After three attempts to shift my choices, I decided I would attempt a meeting with the one and only counselor I was presented with.  Based on only one option, the calendar was hard to schedule with and I had to pick a date two weeks in advance to get a time that matched with my schedule. I didn‚Äôt think too much into this and started to mentally prepare for the visit.  Once my visit came along, I was on my call five minutes in advance and prepared to try and connect with the counselor.  My counselor was late to the meeting and once connected, proceeded to tell me that she didn‚Äôt have access to my records and was not able to meet with me at that moment.  I was a little surprised as I did not have any warning or messaging that anything was awry.  I didn‚Äôt think too deeply into this and agreed to schedule another time once her follow up email was sent.  To my surprise, the counselor listed me as a ‚Äúno show‚Äù to the appointment (that I was present/early on) and I received an email stating that I missed the appointment and ‚Äúwe get it things happen‚Äù.

I honestly felt worse mentally after the attempt at the appointment and shocked at the counselor marking me as absent.  I cancelled my account immediately and asked for a refund.  When support responded back says later, they told me I should have read closer into the fine print and that refunds were not available to customers.

The whole experience was something I have advised against anyone else going through.

Both were eager to listen, to help, and were truly empathetic and understanding. In short, if you are looking for a program that is fairly passive, Cerebral may be fine for you. If you need anything more than a recurring prescription and some basic guidance and exercises, avoid this service.

I had been on a leave of absence from my job due to the issues I was facing, and upon my first visit with both my counselor and my prescriber, I made this known. I also made it known that I would need a letter clearing me to return to work. I was told this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. When I requested that letter, it took over a month for me to receive it. I reached out to my support coordinator and their email support multiple times, just to be given the same canned response that they could not provide that, even though Cerebral‚Äôs own website has specific instructions on how to request that type of document.

Only after my appointment with my counselor where I could explain the situation to her did I get anywhere. She explained my prescriber would be the person I needed to talk to, but I was unable to schedule an appointment with her. My counselor helped me to get an appointment, and upon meeting with the prescriber and explaining the situation, she was shocked at the trouble I had been through getting such a simple request fulfilled. She told me that I would have the note from her in my email within 24 hours, but she actually got it to me in about 20 minutes.

While my counselors and prescriber helped me get through the issues I was initially facing when I started, the resulting financial hardship and strain that resulted from being out of work over a month longer than I expected due to Cerebral‚Äôs lack of care about anything more than collecting a recurring payment from me has brought on a new set of issues.

In the 4 months I‚Äôve had the app, I have seen my prescriber a few times and my care counselor once. I contacted Cerebral earlier this week to ask to cancel the counseling portion of my membership as my care counselor never reached out to schedule an appointment past my first session. Cerebrals customer service number told me I could ‚Äúschedule an appointment with my care counselor if I wanted‚Äù which is untrue. Through the app, unless an appointment is requested to be scheduled by my care team, I‚Äôm unable to make an appointment. Apparently, people who are struggling with mental health are supposed to have to also go out of their way to advocate to receive the service that they are paying for. 

I also had a lapse in medication this week due to an error with my prescriber. I messaged my care team as well as called Cerebral customer service to see what could be done. Customer service told me they would reach out to my prescriber and get back to me within 24-48 hours. After being without my medication for over 2 days, I messaged my care team again, 24 hours after my original message was sent. I was experiencing withdrawal symptoms from not having my medication and expressed I was worried about not taking it for an extended period of time based on the side effects I was having. I had messaged my care team a total of 2 times over a 24 hour period. I got a message from my care team over 26 hours after my original message was sent giving me a ‚Äúgentle reminder‚Äù that they are not a live service and to not message them more than once in a row. I suppose that I was supposed to just be relaxed about my lapse in medication for over 2 days and lack of response from the people responsible for prescribing it for me as I was experiencing bad withdrawal symptoms. 

After getting a call back from cerebral customer support and receiving my medication, I went to cancel my service. One of their options on their customer support number is to cancel service, and when you press the number, it tells you to email a certain email. I did so, and the email sent me back an automated response asking me to fill out a form. This process for cancelling by having to go through 3 different routes seems absolutely ridiculous for people who are seeking help for mental illness. 

Cerebral is absolutely not made for people with mental illnesses in mind.

1) while onboarding I was not able to complete my orientation for at least 24 hours as there was a bug in the system‚Äî I was paying for something I couldn‚Äôt access. Which okay I get things happen but it wasn‚Äôt a great first impression.

2) My first appointment with my prescriber was very impersonal. She did not smile seem interested or act very caring about what I needed other than ‚ÄúI had a lot going on‚Äù. We all have had days but this was my first interaction and I was underwhelmed by her attitude.

3) For my first appointment with my care counselor, I woke up early and was on time, but she did not join. Turns out she quit and nobody informed me until a couple days later. My first payment I didn‚Äôt even see a care team member‚Äî only a prescriber because of the no show and based on the second ones availability. And the second one showed up 10 mins late!!! I thought here we go again. 

4) I kept getting a notification to make an appointment with my prescriber except she didn‚Äôt have any availability for the next six months and because I was on Adderall this is something that has to be prescribed every month as well as meeting with the prescriber. So I reached out to the care team who was able to find a date sometime next week. The problem was my medicine was going to run out by the end of this week and my prescriber wasn‚Äôt answering the care teams messages so I almost ran out of the medicine and we had to get an emergency supply to get me to the next appointment.

I assume it‚Äôs a lot of fake reviews seeing how most of the top recommended reviews reveal the true side of this terrible company.

I recently moved to Cali from a different state and had to change providers. I learned about Cerebral through social media (should‚Äôve been my first red flag). I thought I‚Äôd give it a try as I struggle with ADHD and often get frustrated when having to find new providers that work with my insurance. Unfortunately it has been a huge headache. They refuse to let you talk to your prescribers directly and instead want you to work through their support portal in order to talk to them. This game of telephone has lead to multiple errors from the prescriber as well as severe delays. Cerebral will tell you they need 3 days to communicate with the prescriber only for you to find out the wrong or incomplete info was given to the prescriber which causes another 3-5 day delay. If you want to actually talk to your prescriber directly you must schedule an appointment with them, but you‚Äôll be surprised to find out these prescribers are booked for more than a month out at a time so nothing can be done in a timely manner. This will prevent you from continuing or adjusting your medication which is not acceptable for a service you are paying out of pocket for on top of everything else.

If you think calling cerebral directly would work better to get issues resolved you‚Äôd be incorrect. They will provide little info and ask you for more time. If you want to speak directly to a higher up you‚Äôll also be put in a queue that will last several days before the higher up will contact you directly. What‚Äôs even more appalling is that anything you discuss over the phone is completely forgotten or not recorded for ‚Äúyour‚Äù support team of counselors within the app. So ‚Äúyour‚Äù counselors won‚Äôt take the necessary next steps to resolve the issue and you‚Äôll have to continue to follow up with your team within the app for several days.

This is a company that apparently prides themselves on providing adequate mental healthcare. However they do not actually care about your mental health as you are just another dollar sign. They spend more money on advertising than they do on hiring enough employees as well as training them to provide adequate service.

I used the service because I move around a lot and was looking for more consistency with my medication routine. At first, I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with my service. I had a prescriber who cared and a care counselor who was useful and helped me in relevant ways. For instance, my initial prescriber went out of her way to help me get my medication at an affordable price and went so far as to call me on my personal cell phone to ensure that I was taken care of. 

Everything went down hill when that prescriber left the service. 

I have been bounced around to a new prescriber each month. This means that each month I must go over my entire medication history, relay trauma to a new person, and wait to get an appointment. Appointments with prescribers must be made two months in advance and most have very limited availability (like 10 PM EST). To be quite honest, that wouldn‚Äôt bother me too much as I was getting consistent care. 

But I‚Äôm not. 

Every month since May 2021 I have had to go a week without medication because my prescriber does not renew my prescription. Every month we go through the same routine (regardless of who my current prescriber is): I notice I have 7 pills left and message my care coordinator for a refill, three days later my care coordinator says they will contact my prescriber and let them know, after not hearing something for several days I contact again when I have one or two pills left, my care coordinator says they will contact my prescriber again and they will respond within 48 hours, I call customer service because I need medication, I go through sudden withdrawal for a day while I wait, I get my medication. 

If that wasn‚Äôt enough, I have been switched to a new medication regime with ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE from my prescriber. I was given no instructions or warning that I would be forced to go through withdrawal from my medications I had previously been on. As of right now, I have been trying to contact my ‚Äúcare team‚Äù for over 48 hours for hep with no response. 

The worse part of this experience is I truly, genuinely need help. I have been left in a state where I cannot stand for more than 20 minutes at a time (no shower, no driving, no cleaning, no cooking, no working). I have used every appropriate avenue available to me and have still be IGNORED by this service. 

If you‚Äôre in a situation where you are looking to use this service, please do not. I am begging you. My mental health is absolutely worse since using this service. The worst part is I am now dependent on this medication and cannot terminate usage of the service until I can get an appointment with a psychiatrist who gives a crap about me.",mereweather181818,"Please, for your sake, don‚Äôt.",1,False,2021-12-20 20:07:36,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

They will Mark you as missed your appointment and charge you anyway saying you ‚Äúused their services‚Äù.

Rescheduling... that will add another 2 to 3 week wait to your visits. 

An entire month of service for not one visit.

I was met by a customer service rep who was dead set on telling me know. 

I explained my work situation and how I had lost my job previously to Covid and that I was so excited to use their service but it seemed impossible to see someone. She said it was my fault to cancel and didn‚Äôt care I was trying to simply reschedule. 

I asked for a supervisor to speak to instead because I felt very much unheard (which is crazy for a counseling service) which was met by multiple excuses. Finally she agreed and said someone would call me back. 

Instead I receive an email from the same woman not listening to me saying the decision was FINAL! No refund even if you didn‚Äôt use the services.

The only bright spot for me was meeting with my prescriber ‚Äî she was fantastic. However, there were several times that my appointment was cancelled shortly before our scheduled time. Once I was able to get an appointment, my prescriber asked me if everything was okay and wondered why I had cancelled our last meeting. I told her that I didn‚Äôt and it she was as confused as I was. 

I paid for 3 months and saw a care counselor once. Nice enough person but none of the information was new to me and I didn‚Äôt get much value out of the interaction. Mostly first-level advice and recommendations that you could get from a few books or blog posts. 

The customer support response time was slow and often many of my answers didn‚Äôt get resolved until the 2nd or 3rd time. I really wanted this service to work but unfortunately it seemed to be a lot of good ideas but poor execution. I had 3-4 meetings cancelled with my care counselor day-of and no explanation ‚Äî just an automated email notifying me of the cancelled appointment.

1st: I did not want medication- just therapy. I have a trusted PA that I‚Äôve been working with for years.  I was in crisis. My first therapist tried to upswell me on my plan to include medication.  I was upset and crying and just dismissed it.  Our second session I stated ‚ÄúI will not be discussing that any time soon. I‚Äôm setting a boundary.‚Äù And she seemed receptive.  By the end of the call- I‚Äôm sobbing about how sad I am and how hard I‚Äôm struggling.  She suggests multiple sessions a week and I said that was something I was interested in.  She then proceeded to dump me.  At the end of my second session.  While I was still in crisis.  They don‚Äôt provide that level of care- but she gave me a link to a local mental hospital I could go to get evaluated.  DISGUSTED.  I tried to cancel- and was talked into meeting a new therapist since I was already charged for the next 2 weeks.

2nd: this app GHOSTED ME. my new therapist was great. It‚Äôs why I was on this app for nearly a year.  She was not the problem.  Scheduling sucked.  You can‚Äôt schedule more than one session at a time- and can‚Äôt have a regular time slot.  Inconvenient but my therapist worked with me to set them up.  I‚Äôm in a pretty good place- but entering a VERY STRESSFUL situation (moving to a new country and starting a whole new life by myself).  I got very busy and forgot to schedule 2 or 3 weeks of appointments.  No one contacted me. I logged on to schedule an appointment and the app wouldn‚Äôt let me select the option.  I chalked it up to a glitch, and decided to try later.  The next three attempts over the next few days were the same. A full booking cycle had gone by and I had paid in full when I had zero sessions (AGAIN- WAS NOT CONTACTED). I got charged again- and reached out and was told that I didn‚Äôt complete the cancel.  I‚Äôm still jumping through hoops to cancel like this is a toxic gym membership and not tool for mental health.  I think my doctor was great- but I do wonder why she didn‚Äôt reach out, or if she was unable, why didn‚Äôt my ‚Äúcare team‚Äù reach out? 

Luckily, I made progress and am strong enough to make it through this- but I cannot imagine if I had been first dumped on the second session and then ghosted after nearly a year if I was still in a dark place.  Especially considering what both therapists knew what I was trying to heal.

 I‚Äôm my experience- if I failed to schedule- my therapist would have checked in until they knew I was safe.

Additionally, if I had been in a poorer mental state this could have also been dangerous. 

I paid for medication management and care counseling. While there were expected frustrations like connectivity issues, late provider, or generic advice, the most egregious issue was with my medication management. 

During my first meeting with my prescriber, I made it very clear that I would not be taking a certain medication due to negative experiences in the past. Despite this, and without consulting me again, I was sent this medication. I contacted my ‚Äúcare team‚Äù and reminded them/expressed my concern, and they apologized and I was refunded the price of the medication. 

Then I was sent ANOTHER refill of this unwanted and unneeded medication, enough medication that could have easily been used to self-harm or at the least have negative side effects, which I was clear about in my very first meeting. 

After contacting my care team in addition to customer service, I was repeatedly asked me to explain the situation, which I did. My specific concerns about the potential dangers and unethical willingness to send out medication against a patient‚Äôs wishes, plus the lack of internal communication between members of the care team, were not addressed. I was merely offered a discount for the next few months of service. 

I asked for a refund of the undesired medication and for the month I did not use any counseling services since it was clear they were not listening, but these were not granted. 

Other less serious problems made it an annoying service: the advice or response from my counselor was problematic (wording suggesting we should be grateful for traumatic experiences) and the type of advice anyone could get from a Google search.

The app itself is a mess, lots of bugs, did not retain my insurance information, and the telemedicine function is also very janky. 

But I could forgive the above if the service was actually worthwhile. Basically, this is only worth anything at all if you have no insurance and just need access to medicine. The counseling function is worthless - 30 minutes a month and they forced me to changed counselors after one session with no notice or reason. Who wants to start working with a counselor and keep changing? 

I also had an issue where I had a bad experience with one of the prescriptions. I notified them and it went through what seems to be a bunch of different channels of decision makers until they finally got me a new prescription - but once that new prescription was filled, it pushed my other prescription‚Äôs refill date out two additional weeks. Now my monthly medication has a two week gap - not good for the obvious reasons.

When I relayed my issues to Cerebral, I got a canned ‚Äúsorry you are unhappy with your medication delivery‚Äù and offered me 30% off for three weeks. What? I‚Äôm saying there‚Äôs a whole host of issues, one of which is this odd delay in one of prescriptions, and this support agent boils it down to ‚Äúsorry we couldn‚Äôt get you your meds fast enough, here‚Äôs a discount.‚Äù

Ironic for a mental-health app. 

Pros:

- My therapist was great. :)
- You get a selection of therapists that you can choose from
- You can dispute it with your bank for a refund, so that was nice!

Cons:

- I paid on August 28th for my September therapy sessions. I e-mailed in on August 29th to cancel my membership. Per my e-mail, I stated, ‚ÄúI understand that this month has already been paid for as I would like to finish up my therapy sessions for this month.‚Äù The Employee responded with, ‚ÄúI would advise to request your cancellation by 9 am PT one business day before your next scheduled billing date to cancel your account as we have no way to have it set to cancel at a specific date.‚Äù 

I understand there‚Äôs no way to set a specific date to cancel, so I requested to cancel asap as it‚Äôs understandably uncomfortable to rely on customer support to actually cancel a day prior to the next billing date. Once I cancelled my subscription, it *also* cancelled my service for the month that *I had already paid for*. This doesn‚Äôt make sense and is not customer-service friendly or mental-health friendly ‚Äî it comes off as a money-hungry company. Why would you cancel the service for the month that you had already paid ahead of time for?  When it comes to any other service that you pay ahead of time for, once you cancel and get the confirmation of cancellation, it is applicable to the next billing cycle as you maintain the service for the remainder of which you had already paid for. After asking one last time for a refund and kindly requesting for said Employee to provide some Customer Support, I was responded with:

‚ÄúPlease be advised that we operate on a subscription model, the monthly fee is not based on services being rendered (i.e., receiving new medication, meeting with a therapist or prescriber). I do know that this is not the response that you would like to receive, and I sincerely apologize that we cannot be more flexible here. I completely understand your disappointment and do hope that you are able to find care that is a great fit for you.‚Äù

The Employee was kind and respectful, but as a Customer Support employee myself who also works in a Subscription field, I do not think much customer support was provided, especially when I kindly asked  for a refund a couple of times. It was rather a robotic response with a lack of empathy; you *can* be more flexible, but you choose not to; you can escalate it, give a customer a one-time courtesy refund so that they will come back.

I was charged $85 for services for the month of June and was just told yesterday that they could not provide those services because I do not have a state ID for the state I just moved to. For further context, I did NOT need a state ID to receive services in the last state I lived in and I communicated to Cerebral and my previous prescriber for MONTHS that I would be moving to another state and told them specifically which state I was moving to. 

I explained the situation to the person helping me through the ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù feature through the app and the representative said it was against Cerebral policy to provide me with a refund for the services that I could not have access to. I did not have a single session with a prescriber or care counselor during the month of June.

Please refer to our Recurring Billing Policy and Terms and Conditions, which you have agreed on when you signed up.

At first, I thought it was great and convenient. Everything from your phone, friendly care coordinators, decent website. But then the provider issues started coming, and it‚Äôs been a compounding landslide of a fourth month nightmare.

I first used cerebral in October. To receive accommodations, I needed to get a form filled out by my prescriber. I emailed her the first week of November, was told it would be back by the end of the week. At the end of the week, no form: I emailed, and same thing. Eventually, after a few weeks of this, as well as bringing it up at my appointment in December, I still never received it. I sent another email, mentioned it again at my January appointment, was told it‚Äôs be here by the end of the week.

The first week of this February, I contacted my care coordinator, who said she would contact the provider about the forms, four months after starting services services. She did. I didn‚Äôt hear anything, and contacted her again. She said she emailed the provider but no word.  Through the next 3 weeks, I contacted the care provider three or four times about the form and getting it filled out, and no word.

By this time I needed to submit the form by the end of the week to receive accommodations. I called customer service, was told they will look into getting me a new provider and email me. They emailed me and I returned the call to schedule an appointment with a new provider. The new service rep I now spoke with was completely confused about the scenario. Nonetheless, she was able to get me an emergency spot with a new provider Thursday, hoping that I could get the form to submit by Friday. The new provider was in Tennessee. I live in California. Legally they can‚Äôt prescribe narcotics across state lines. He apologized and said, ‚Äúyeah, someone over there is messin up man!‚Äù

I was unable to receive accommodations for my PHD exams, despite a four month head start effort, due to Cerebral. 

I‚Äôm just bummed, and it feels predatory. I feel like cerebral took advantage of those with mental illness by making it seem like an accessible service that‚Äôs easy to use. After luring you in, your connected with out of state providers, confused workers, and overly apologetic coordinators that provide apologies instead of solutions. You‚Äôre prescribed meds, and don‚Äôt wanna risk finding another doctor in fear of not being able to get them refilled. It‚Äôs been a nightmare, and having worked in medical offices, it‚Äôs just bizarre how poor this company operates and treats clients. A four page Q&A form with circle the answer questions, and four months in, dozens of emails, nothing but a few bank statements of me paying for this service. It‚Äôs a tragic excuse for psych aid for anybody who needs medical care, and if receiving consistent and safe medicine and treatment is important please consider other sites or firms.",norcalfog,"A waking, predatory nightmare.",1,False,2022-02-24 22:55:27,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

Where to start? First, my ‚Äúprovider‚Äù shows up to our first video conference wearing a beanie and a hoody, like did you just wake up? I get it‚Äôs COVID season and we are having to do Telehealth but how unprofessional... Then to make it better my provider prescribes me a prescription which she says will be sent off and processed that same day to ship. We are going on 5 days with no update. 

The ‚Äúchat‚Äù you get with your counselor and care coordinator isn‚Äôt live so you‚Äôre lucky if one of them sees it and responds when you need them to. I reached out to them and got a minimal response saying ‚Äúoh she‚Äôs working on it‚Äù. 

Last night I sent an email to their contact support explaining my situation and received a response saying that my situation was getting transferred to someone else that dealt with providers and prescriptions as it was a very serious matter and would be handled as soon as possible. I waited all day and heard nothing so I called their contact hotline for live support to see if I could get an update on what was going on. I was placed on hold with a statement saying your expected wait time is 4 minutes... 12 minutes later I was forwarded to an answering machine. Have I gotten a response? Negative ghost rider.

,"I have been a customer of Cerebral since July 2021, and in my time as a customer I have not had a single month where there hasn't been some kind of issue regarding obtaining my prescriptions. 

Not to mention, upon signing up to receive Cerebral's therapy and medication management service, I was not informed prior to the expiration of the first month @ $35 introductory offer, which inflated to over $300 without notice. I should have listened to the warning bells going off in my head after this first incident, however I was not in a financial position to obtain mental health services from another provider at the time.

Cerebral's mission of ""breaking down the barriers for access to mental healthcare"" is laughable, as my experience with Cerebral has been one of facing constant barriers. 

Barrier #1 - I have not been able to obtain my prescribed medications due to FREQUENT issues regarding dosage amounts and name brand vs generic mix-ups. However, Cerebral continues to charge me for a bogus ""medication management"" service. Additionally, I relocated from WA to MA and was required to restart my care with a different provider, even though all of my information was already with Cerebral. I had this new appointment with a provider on Oct 1, but have still not been able to obtain 3 out of my 4 prescribed medications as of today, Oct 22.
Barrier #2 - I am unable to connect directly with my provider and am instead routed through a ""care team"" to discuss sensitive matters regarding my medication status and mental health.
Barrier #3 - I was PATRONIZED by a ""care team"" member attempting to justify the cost of Cerebral's services in response to an unauthorized charge of $300+. I subsequently requested that my concerns be brought to a supervisor, however I only received a partial refund.

For a company claiming to provide mental health support services, Cerebral falls drastically short. Providing access to medication for mental health requires the highest level of attention-to-detail and follow-through. Cerebral demonstrates neither. Inconsistencies in medication usage can lead to severe consequences, including suicide. 

I am obtaining counsel to support me in resolving these issues with Cerebral, and will also be posting this communication on Cerebral's Apple App Store as a review, as well as Trust Pilot, and the Better Business Bureau.",emilywestmanfigs,**CEREBRAL IS A DANGER TO MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS***,1,False,2021-10-22 21:29:23,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

,"I was excited about trying this app ‚Äì I‚Äôve had the option of other platforms like better help and Talkspace for a while, but Cerebral promises online psychiatry, not just general physicians (to prescribe you medications) and talk therapy. I wanted the expertise of a psychiatrist when it comes to prescriptions‚Äì they understand the mind, and that‚Äôs the reason why I decided to try cerebral. Unfortunately, the psychiatry element is all marketing. My prescriber had no background in psych at all, no expertise in any amount of mental health issues, and made me feel so uncomfortable within the first five minutes of talking to him I ended up cancelling my whole subscription then and there. He giggled at really serious issues, made blanket statements back to me that sounded like he got them from an anti-depressant commercial, and behaved so awkwardly and strangely that it truly seemed like he didn‚Äôt understand even the most basic social cues, let alone anything about psychiatry. I am fully convinced that our conversation was his first encounter in the professional medical realm. 

Aside from that, when you are booking appointments with your therapist, you are only showing availability in the far future. It looks like everyone of their therapist is booked up completely for weeks. When you call them, they will be able to tell you availability within the next few days for that person, that you cannot see on your side of the application. When I had to reschedule an appointment, I was only given availability for three weeks later, so I had to call. The person on the phone told me my therapist had availability the next day. That was nowhere on my app. So you may end up paying for four talk therapy sessions a month, and only being able to schedule two or three of them, simply because you don‚Äôt know their true availability.Would not recommend.",Spraych,"Prescriber was barely out of medschool, had no idea what he was doing",1,False,2022-07-25 15:53:06,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

,"Quickly becomes apparent that this is more like a bait & switch scam than a convenient and cost effective mental healthcare platform. Trial month followed by $85 recurring charge (not including $75/month prescription in my case), and no prescriber appointments were even available within my first trial month, which are required to start, or in my case continue, treatment. There is no option to contact Cerebral beyond the chat, and replies take over 24 hours (phone number listed has four option that all redirect you to chat within app). I have screen shot my chat history to document the two months of hassle and back-and-forth for issues big and small; among them, prescriber not following up with me initially for over a week despite telling me it would only be a day or two (and then incorrectly saying she had tried to reach out earlier - false), not providing required diagnostic code to pharmacy when submitting prescription, then providing me with the code rather than submitting herself as requested/required by the pharmacy. You would assume the refill process would have gone better, yet I was told by my prescriber that this would be submitted at the time we spoke ten days ago. I‚Äôve had to contact Cerebral almost every day since then, and have been provided multiple excuses citing system errors and computer glitches as to why my medication has not been mailed or called into my pharmacy. Keep in mind, you usually have to wait at least 24 hours to receive a response to each of your inquires. Latest update is that they claim my prescription had at last been mailed through FedEx, yet was cancelled by me. Absolutely false, never requested cancellation of the order, and don‚Äôt even see option to do so, but I‚Äôm sure they know this. Cerebral has not been able to provide timely care or even basic refills, and at $160 this is hardly a cost effective option for mental health care. In my case, I am now motivated to seek psychologist/psychiatrist care through private health insurance as soon as possible. I am also submitting a complaint and review to the Better Business Bureau (not that Cerebral is even accredited). These are not certified psychologists or psychiatrists. They are also unable to prescribe the typical and most effective medications to treat ADHD (stimulants like Adderall).

I liked my initial provider but they switched me to a new provider after my initial appointment stating that my provider was on vacation for 3 months. My second provider was even better. Until after 2-3 visits they discovered they made a mistake and my provider wasn‚Äôt credentialed with my insurance company. In the meantime, over my 6ish months with Cerebral, I was only able to get my medication in a timely manner for the first 2 months. After that there was an issue every single time where they said my meds would be delivered but they never shipped. I switched to having it sent to my local pharmacy but that was even worse because my prescriptions were never sent over and I would have to hound the care coordinators to get it each month. Back to the providers, the second switch due to Cerebrals error was my last straw and I decided to cancel even though I was almost out of meds and they wouldn‚Äôt help me get a refill. That‚Äôs not the end of my frustration with Cerebral though. After I cancelled all of the sudden in April Cerebral and the provider filed a claim on my insurance for a visit in January when there had never been any previous claims filed. They knew she was out of network so I can imagine why they wanted to file a claim now. The bill was $209.83 and Cerebral refused to answer emails about it until they tried to charge me $72.66 of it. I filed a claim with the BBB. Cerebral said they would reach out to me but a month later never have. Finally they refunded me most of the months services I paid for. But there is still an open claim with my insurance and they haven‚Äôt communicated with me to respond and confirm if they are still pursuing that claim.

I know what I am talking about and am not some red-flag patient or drug-seeker who complains about everything. At first I thought Cerebral would be an a godsend after years of PAs and CRNPs running through different combinations of the same meds unsuccessfully for TRD in a large health system that had tons of red tape and overwhelmed providers with poor training who frequently quit. I had high hopes after my initial meetings with Cerebral. Now, about 6 months in, I am so fed up that I needed to post a review, because Cerebral makes good provision of care IMPOSSIBLE. I got set up with an awesome provider on the other side of the country who has been totally revamping my med regimen. She's wonderful and an MD, and the only reason I now stay. That's where the good ends. You get NO ACCESS TO RECORDS at all, not even when your last appointment was or visit summaries. If you need something like paperwork, rescheduling, testing, work letters, etc you HAVE to go through Cerebral's people- and you will get no responses for days or weeks, if you EVER get a response at all. For example, my provider repeatedly requested ADHD testing; they never sent it (in hindsight, probably because they no longer allow prescribing of most ADHD meds and didn't want to lose a customer by getting a diagnosis.) 
We later had to request a medical letter for work b/c of severe discontinuation syndrome while weaning off a long-time SNRI. It took several weeks and multiple contacts from my doc for them to send me the letter. (When they did send it, it had huge Cerebral letterhead with ""Psychiatry Department"" in big letters, so I couldn't even use it- I didn't want to get fired, but I also didn't want to be stigmatized at my job when the office manager was my direct supervisor. I ended up quitting my job instead.) My provider had to give me her personal cell phone early on, because whenever we needed something it would take so long (and sometimes never happen at all, despite multiple requests.) 
My ""Care Counselor"" changed multiple times and finally I just stopped even trying (I can't imagine how bad trying to get full therapy is). They were useless anyway; just gave you pre-packaged advice you could get from Google. 
And finally, they recently ""updated"" a bunch of policies regarding 1) what meds can be prescribed and 2) how clients will be charged and for what.
I fought for a week to get a cancellation fee taken off when I accidentally clicked on an appointment for the wrong month and it was only two hours away (ie, meant to hit June 20th at 2pm, accidentally tapped on May 20th at 2pm, and it was currently May 20th at 12pm.) I cancelled it immediately after making it when I realized my mistake- literally two minutes later- and they still charged me $29 and would NOT take it off, even after I escalated the complaint. 
Oh, and if you try to complain or get an issue resolved, however cordially, they will send you bot-generated policy quotes repeatedly without even reading your email. (They sent me the same automated copy-paste email reply 3 times that did not address my actual issue, proving they had not read the email- OOPS, fake customer service exposed!) 
Also, your provider will be very limited in what they can do for you. I am being weaned off of a long-time antidepressant and am experiencing debilitating discontinuation syndrome. My doctor flat out told me that what I really need is temporary benzos, but she can't prescribe them because of Cerebral's new rules. I've never had an addiction or misused meds or even been on benzos before, but I can't have them because of a blanket policy. 
So as soon as I get stable again on the new meds, I am OUT, because even the best provider is made useless by Cerebral's overbearing policies. Your doctor will not be able to treat you the way they should; Cerebral will bill you for an accidental tap of the finger even when no one's time was used, no one lost an appointment slot, no one even knew any appointment had been made, and said appointment only existed for about 30 seconds! They will not give you paperwork you need, and if you try to complain about any of it, they will have a bot with a fake human name quote policy at your repeatedly without even reading your email before finally saying ""you agreed to be charged the cancellation fee when you canceled"" (I had to, or I couldn't cancel it.) 
In summary, Cerebral: 1) Gets you in the door with great providers. 2) Cripples those providers and does not allow them to provide the best care. 3.) Does not provide any customer service or record-keeping, 4.) Tries to fake you out and make you go away by using bot generated customer service emails. 5.)

Errors with prescriptions are too numerous to count. They forget to send it to the pharmacy or your prescriber quits and you have to wait for a new one before you can have your prescription refilled. The customer support is a joke. Its not necessarily the fault of the customer service agents themselves, but they are genuinely no help.

I signed up for the basic and cheapest plan - medication and care counselor. Your care coordinator is the middle man between you and your prescriber, who you have no way of speaking to in between virtual appointments. I made my first 30 min appointment with my prescriber and they didn‚Äôt show up, so that wasn‚Äôt an endearing start to this program. I rescheduled for a couple days later. That is a positive - I was able to get appointments very quickly after signing up. My first actual visit with my prescriber was ok but they seemed very bored, like this wasn‚Äôt anything they wanted to do. I was prescribed adderall XR after a series of questions and me explaining my symptoms, what I have trouble with etc. it was very easy to get prescribed adderall. So, great for people who need the help. The problem I had was that I never received treatment. I had to confirm with my care counselor - who was very friendly and nice - that my prescription was sent to my pharmacy. So I waited, and waited, and waited. My prescription still wasn‚Äôt ready. I had to go in to my pharmacy and asked what was going on. They said they needed the diagnosis code from my prescriber in order for my insurance to cover the cost of meds. This is 2 weeks since I was prescribed adderall. Another week goes by. I have to reach out to my team and ask what‚Äôs going on. My coordinator was very nice but I kept having to message them. I felt like I was in the dark. I ended up contacting support, which was absolutely no help. So by now, I have received a response in my message portal saying the diagnosis code was given and was just waiting on if any more info was needed. I had contacted my pharmacy again just to confirm this was true‚Ä¶ they said the issue is still unresolved, that my prescription will expire in less than a week and I could pay out of pocket‚Ä¶ but I have insurance for a reason - I will essentially be paying $85 a month for this medication. At this point I decided to cancel because my second month payment will withdraw in a couple days and I still haven‚Äôt received treatment! This experience was way more frustrating than I expected.

(I‚Äôll not even bother getting into the first practitioner I seen basically told me she couldn‚Äôt help me and was passing me on to someone more qualified. Just to pass me to someone that had zero clue what was going on so I had to start over with her and she was actually pretty judgmental- that was real fun, said no one reaching out for help.) The second month came and I had my appointment the same day as finishing my previous month‚Äôs prescription. Had my apt, doctor knew I was officially out of my meds because I told her and while having our apt reiterated where to send my meds and that she was doing so, just like the previous month. Thought all was fine. It wasn‚Äôt. The next day, 3/15, I went to my pharmacy to get my medicine and they had nothing for me and no new prescription had been called in. I left the pharmacy and went home and messaged Cerebral right away about what was going on. I finally hear back almost 24 hours later and yet still no prescription or solution. They can‚Äôt get thru to my prescriber or the on call. Meanwhile this place has many doctors they could have easily started reaching out to so we could get the prescription taken care of immediately. But no. More days have gone by. No one does anything to help knowing that the psych medication is much needed, can make me very sick without out it, and most importantly, how dangerous it is to stop these medications ‚Äúcold turkey‚Äù. They finally message me Saturday(3/19) evening at 655pm, that my prescription had been sent. I messaged back that that was no longer helpful and they were days late in solving a problem that needed attention immediately. It wasn‚Äôt helpful because my pharmacy was already closed for the day and they are closed on Sundays. I wrote them this immediately and never heard back about what to do next. No one at Cerebral had offered any solutions in getting me my prescription immediately so I wouldn‚Äôt have to be sick. I feel this is very unacceptable and disappointing, being it‚Äôs a mental health facility. I‚Äôve been home, alone with no help, with a toddler, sick for days because of this negligence. I had not been able to do anything around the house and struggled to even care for myself and my 3 year old because Ive been so sick from not having my medicine. Now that it‚Äôs been 6/7 days without my prescription my meds will be mostly, if not all the way, be out of my system and I‚Äôll have to start all over. Back to square one! Getting to that point was hard enough! It took me weeks to even take the steps to make the appointment and start the process of speaking to a doctor and starting a medication. Now I have to look elsewhere and begin again. They know this, it‚Äôs a mental health center, yet are treating the situation like it‚Äôs no big deal. It‚Äôs a very very big deal. This is NOT ok and I plan to look into some kind of justice being done.

I have filed a complaint with the FTC as they have broken a lease or regulation regarding subscription cancelation ease and have extremely bad business practices. I suggest others who have had A similar experience do the same, in hopes that cerebral will be required to change and prevent others from having to go through the stress.

My personal experience:
I got to meet with a nurse in the first week, however the half hour allotted ended up being less than 5 minutes. The nurse was 15 minutes late and didn‚Äôt make up for it with extra minutes after the appointment would‚Äôve ended, and she left our appointment five minutes before it was scheduled to end. I was told I should get the premium package with therapy (after I expressed I wasn‚Äôt interested in that because I have a in person therapist) and I was also told that I need to speak to a different nurse practitioner.
A week goes by and finally the app allowed me to schedule with the different nurse practitioner. It would be near the end of my trial but that was OK. However, an emergency on my end came up and I had to cancel my appointment. Her next available appointment wasn‚Äôt for another three months! Cerebral would not let me schedule with a different nurse, only her. Even if I wanted to temporarily cancel my subscription until then, my appointments would all be canceled as well. So, my only option was to schedule that appointment and pay $85 minimum for three more months before I could even potentially get help. 
In the third of my fourth week, I was scheduled to meet with a doctor. Cerebral canceled my appointment about 24 hours before it was scheduled. Her next availability wasn‚Äôt until weeks after my trial would end, so I tried looking for other doctors with their service. Again, I can schedule with anyone other than that person.
I wrote a complaint and asked to unsubscribe via email to their customer support. It took them three days to respond at which point they said they can‚Äôt offer me a refund. That‚Äôs OK, I just wanted to stop my subscription. When they emailed me back, they said I had missed the deadline (according to the TOS; two business days by 9 AM via email before the new invoice is printed) I would need to pay the $85 for the upcoming month, even though I wouldn‚Äôt have access to my account because I had canceled. I responded back to them because my initial email which was sent before that deadline stated I wanted to cancel, and their initial response didn‚Äôt occur until a few hours after the deadline- which gave me zero opportunity to try to properly cancel (again). They responded back and said they cannot help me.
I had to put a lock on my bank account for over a month to avoid their attempts at charging me. I was getting emails demanding I pay it. Eventually, it stopped and I haven‚Äôt heard from them again.
However, making a subscription harder to cancel than it is to sign up for is against FTC‚Äôs laws and regulations. 

And, a heads up-if you do decide to switch your program with the trial offer (which clearly states it is for any of the programs), it will try to charge you the full price‚Äôs difference. Even though the receipt will say $0 due, when you hit submit to switch to a premium plan during your trial period, it will automatically try to charge your bank over $200 for a few days. I contacted customer support about this, and they were again of no help.",toriht123,Predatory,1,False,2022-02-05 19:18:19,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

At first, after initially having a consultation with the psychiatric nurse practitioner and then scheduling and meeting with my care provider, I thought this was good. 

My experience after that has been less than stellar. It turns out there was an error with getting my medicine filled. Which caused a delay. I understand times are tough, etc. but I was told it was an error in their system, not necessarily the pharmacy‚Äôs fault. 

I finally got my medication and began taking it. I was supposed to take two medications. One I was to take one pill a day for two weeks and then take two a day until my refill came in. 

Here it is the end of December, and I‚Äôve only received on round of medication. I asked why it wasn‚Äôt filled out because it‚Äôs important to take your medicine as prescribed and not miss a dose. I reached out to my care provider who said it appears there was, get this, another error in fulfilling my medication so I didn‚Äôt have any medicine whatsoever. 

They sent in a prescription to my local pharmacy that I had to pay additional money for, to hold me over for two weeks until my new medicine is sent to me. 

What bothered me was that one of the medicines that I was taking two of (went from 20mg to 40mg) was refilled for..20mg. And I was told to only take one day. The dosage and instructions are completely messed up. The communication is completely out of alignment. I broke this down to my care provider out of concern that the nurse practitioner wasn‚Äôt even following the medication instructions she gave me. I was simply followed up with a ‚ÄúWe are sorry. This is our fault‚Äù with no further corrections provided. Literally so now I‚Äôm taking a smaller dosage then what I‚Äôm supposed to be taking because the practitioner didn‚Äôt send in the new dosage that I have been on. It‚Äôs not been consistent and the attention to details and errors are too lackluster to recommend this service right now. You shouldn‚Äôt guarantee a service when you can‚Äôt fulfill your duties to your patients. I‚Äôve now paid over $200.00 and have only had one prescription filled (plus out of costs prescription for pharmacy) and two small 30 minute sessions with a care counselor that you barely even have time to really work through problems with for it to be even remotely worthwhile.

,"A couple weeks ago I was trying to enter my insurance information into the website & app.  I have ‚ÄúDirect Care Administrators‚Äù insurance.  This is listed on the drop down of accepted insurances for medical & for prescription on both your website & your app.  So I assumed there was an error happening with the app.  I sent a email in to support.  I kept getting emails with ‚ÄúFAQ‚Äù and not anything to actually help me.  I decided that since my insurance was listed & I would benefit from therapy services as well to go ahead and sign up for the prescription, counselor, & therapy option.  I do this thinking my insurance was accepted by cerebral so it would not be a huge charge to me directly as my insurance was again listed as an accepted insurance on both the medical & prescription drop downs on the website & app.  When I went to do this once I selected to upgrade there was no option to go back, I was informed I would be charged ‚Äúthe difference‚Äù from what I had already paid to the upgrade.  There was zero mention anywhere saying refunds would only be given at 50%.  Since I couldn‚Äôt go back I had no option but to keep going forward despite the website not registering my insurance that was listed on the drop down.  Because it wouldn‚Äôt accept my insurance when I tried to enter it after selecting from the drop down of accepted insurance & then I saw a $240 charge to my checking account I immediately cancelled the ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù & change it back to what I previously selected which was prescription & counseling.  I then called into Cerebral to figure out why my insurance was on the drop down & the app not website would take it when I entered my insurance information.  I was told by the person I spoke to when I called in that my insurance was not actually accepted by cerebral for medical but was accepted for prescription.  It was listed in both areas in the drop down on the app & website.  I asked if I could be refunded for the upgrade that was made on my account & immediately changed back to prescription & counseling.  I was informed I would be & she would notify the department who was responsible for refunds.  I was never told anything about a refund not being for the full $240.  This was an error on Cerebral‚Äôs part for having listed my insurance as being accepted by Cerebral on the website & app.  Had my insurance been accepted like the drop downs on the website & app showed it was I would have remained with the higher plan.  But because it wasn‚Äôt I can‚Äôt afford to pay for therapy services out of pocket.  So I cancelled it & figured I would need to find a provider who accepted my insurance.  I then noticed a few days later a $120 refund into my account.  I was charged $240, not $120 so because I was confused as to why I wasn‚Äôt refunded the full $240 for a service I was never provided, was only upgraded in my account for a total of less than 5 minutes, I called Cerebral again.  The person I spoke to when I called said there was a ‚Äúpolicy of 50%‚Äù refund.  I asked where I would have been informed of this because had I known that this existed I would have called in to verify my insurance as opposed to upgrading with the knowledge of being informed by your website & app that my insurance was accepted.  I was told this was something that was ‚Äúonly on our end‚Äù as in that I the customer couldn‚Äôt see anywhere that this 50% refund policy even existed & only people on the Cerebral employee end could see.  It‚Äôs extremely poor customer service & extremely poor treatment for a service that is to be providing mental health services.  The person I spoke to despite me trying to explain this continued to read a scripted message over me trying to talk to her.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, she responded saying ‚Äúyou want to speak with a supervisor?‚Äù  I said ‚Äúyes‚Äù.  She responded saying ‚Äúthere isn‚Äôt one available but I can have a supervisor give you a call back‚Äù.  I told her I would like for this to happen & the call ended.  It has been 5 days now & I haven‚Äôt received any call back from a supervisor.  Out of my own curiosity because I didn‚Äôt recall seeing on the app or website anything about a ‚Äú50% refund‚Äù I went looking through all of the ‚ÄúFAQ‚Äù areas, all of the website & was unable to locate anything that said this.  I assumed maybe it showed up when I went to upgrade plans, so I went back to the upgrade area & figured I would click to upgrade & since I already was aware once you select to upgrade that you can‚Äôt go back on the app I decided I would just close out the app instead of selecting the only option on the app which was to go forward I would close the app out completely & not upgrade.  So I went to do this, & when I selected to upgrade to the prescription, counseling, & therapy services there was a pop up this time that did not happen before when I had done this & was charged $240.  The pop up informed me that Cerebral was not able to provide ‚Äútherapy services in my state‚Äù (Utah).  So Cerebral showed my insurance as an accepted insurance in their drop down list despite it not being accepted by them, charged me for medical services that they legally cannot even provide in my state, and despite both of these problems being at the fault of Cerebral misinforming customers they refused to refund me for the full $240 I was charged. When upgrading it also does not tell you what the cost is for the higher plan, it only says you will be charged for the difference of the plan you selected originally and the upgraded plan.  I would highly recommend anyone considering using Cerebral to call them directly before signing up, selecting any services, etc.  From my experience what I was told on the app & website was not at all accurate.",Karb03,Please read if you are considering using Cerebral services,1,False,2021-10-16 16:34:16,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

Because it‚Äôs seems to be impossible to cancel this service. They do only take $20.00 from your card after that you will get billed your portion that your insurance evidently didn‚Äôt cover  for services you didn‚Äôt agree to or know about . You will get text messages and reminders for appointments  they  make for you  even after you thought you canceled the service.If like me you need psychiatric prescription medication you will only find out after you‚Äôve signed up that Cerebral doesn‚Äôt offer prescription medication as part of your therapy  claiming state laws making it illegal,Gillestupidy,Impossible to cancel,1,False,2021-07-02 18:43:01,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671

Complete opposite. They have a list of conditions that they are not allowed to help. Which they conveniently do not tell you or list anywhere.You don‚Äôt qualify for counseling you don‚Äôt qualify for psychiatric help. However none of this is made it public knowledge before you sign it . You find out when you meet a psychiatrist and they say literally within the first five minutes there‚Äôs nothing we can do for you but you can talk to the counselor and they say exactly the same thing. Surprise surprise yet another person who can‚Äôt help you and you know what the counselor says let me talk to the company and see if I can still do it weeks go by and they try to charge your card a second time. All you Get out of this is 10 minutes of people telling you they can‚Äôt help you and you said $150. In this case convenience is not the best option.

They let you think it‚Äôs 30.00, but that‚Äôs only for the first month. They surprise charge you $85.00 MINIMUM the next month.  They lack communication. Not only did I not get my rx in the 2 days like they advertise, but the ‚Äúcare councilor‚Äù scheduled an appt with me and never entered it. Found out when I inquired about it they said she left...I never got word about it from anyone.  On top of it all they sent me a new counselor who decided to inform me that it was basically my fault for not saying anything to let them know she left.... they don‚Äôt read your messages since you will have to repeatedly ask the same thing multiple times. Go with your insurance or a REAL clinical office, because this app is a joke and not worth the hassle, time and frustration you will receive as ‚Äúcare‚Äù. Not even worth being free.",poopstick mcgreedy,Don‚Äôt bother,1,True,2021-04-16 20:36:20,cerebral-mental-health,1537193671
