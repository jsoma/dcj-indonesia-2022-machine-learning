1,"My last review got deleted. This app does not provide the service it appears to. Like the other reviews say its not a texting therapy app, you wait for hours and don't get responses. Talk space has a 1 star review on BBB which is pretty safe to say its a scam. Its a shame to profit off of people searching for help is such a dark time. Shame on you talk space. For the amount of money required to sign up vs the product given in return it is clear this is not a good company or app. 

To the customer support team and whoever is reading these reviews I want a refund.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,1.0,1.0,0.0

I emailed customer service and messaged my “care team” via the desktop website, and they have either not responded after a number of days, or the person was seemingly even less qualified to answer my own question than I am.

2,You pay a monthly fee up front and it guarantees you a certain number of contacts. I’ve yet to receive any services. My provider missed her reply window 3 times in a row so I’m paying for a essentially a subscription with no benefit. I’m sure they are overwhelmed with clients but they need to stop enrolling people and taking their money if they can’t provide what’s promised.

- unable to schedule with prescriber for months on end. Availability in app does not match prescriber availability, but you’re not allowed to contact them directly to clean that up.

1,I had downloaded this app over a year ago when I was going through a hard time in my life. This app really helped me work through issues and better my mental well-being. As a college student it was so refreshing to find such a good resource that didn’t add to my financial stress. I just logged into Youper to do my mental health check-in and found that the practically all of the resource that I had relied upon to help me I now had to have a subscription for!

1,"This was a pretty miserable experience. My therapist sent me one text a day, asking for clarification on things I went into extreme detail about. Then she wouldn’t do anything with the extra information I gave her. She just moved on. I expressed frustration, but she made it seem like it was my fault, so I dropped it.

About two weeks I asked her to hold me accountable with some goals. I figure if she’s only gonna text me once, she can at least check to make sure I’m doing what I want to be doing, but she didn’t. She didn’t check on me for a week. And I really needed help during that week. What could have been a small conversation turned into me staying inside for 4 days.

This past week (our final week together), we’ve mostly been trying to schedule a video call because she has a different schedule than what’s on Talkspace and many in person clients who are clearly the priority. However, we weren’t able to figure it out and now I won’t get to use it. 

Additionally she never talked about making a plan based on what I told her. We never went over any assessments. (Besides her literally reading the results. I know what the answers say I wrote them.) Nor did we talk about the Talkspace program itself. So it looks like there are a lot of really cool features that I missed out on. 

It says you guys use licensed therapists but if you asked me I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between this program and a kind middle schooler with too much time on their hands.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,0.0,0.0,1.0

1,"Cerebral tends to be money-hungry. Ironic for a mental-health app. 

Pros:

- My therapist was great. :)
- You get a selection of therapists that you can choose from
- You can dispute it with your bank for a refund, so that was nice!

Cons:

- I paid on August 28th for my September therapy sessions. I e-mailed in on August 29th to cancel my membership. Per my e-mail, I stated, “I understand that this month has already been paid for as I would like to finish up my therapy sessions for this month.” The Employee responded with, “I would advise to request your cancellation by 9 am PT one business day before your next scheduled billing date to cancel your account as we have no way to have it set to cancel at a specific date.” 

I understand there’s no way to set a specific date to cancel, so I requested to cancel asap as it’s understandably uncomfortable to rely on customer support to actually cancel a day prior to the next billing date. Once I cancelled my subscription, it *also* cancelled my service for the month that *I had already paid for*. This doesn’t make sense and is not customer-service friendly or mental-health friendly — it comes off as a money-hungry company. Why would you cancel the service for the month that you had already paid ahead of time for?  When it comes to any other service that you pay ahead of time for, once you cancel and get the confirmation of cancellation, it is applicable to the next billing cycle as you maintain the service for the remainder of which you had already paid for. After asking one last time for a refund and kindly requesting for said Employee to provide some Customer Support, I was responded with:

“Please be advised that we operate on a subscription model, the monthly fee is not based on services being rendered (i.e., receiving new medication, meeting with a therapist or prescriber). I do know that this is not the response that you would like to receive, and I sincerely apologize that we cannot be more flexible here. I completely understand your disappointment and do hope that you are able to find care that is a great fit for you.”

The Employee was kind and respectful, but as a Customer Support employee myself who also works in a Subscription field, I do not think much customer support was provided, especially when I kindly asked  for a refund a couple of times. It was rather a robotic response with a lack of empathy; you *can* be more flexible, but you choose not to; you can escalate it, give a customer a one-time courtesy refund so that they will come back. This may very well not be the employee’s fault, but rather, upper management. Given this experience, I will choose to not come back.",cerebral-mental-health,1.0,0.0,0.0

If you try it out, just make sure you use the $200 off referral link version, I found mines off a YouTube video of someone reviewing this app. At the end of the day I only spent $60 trying it out with the basic plan, so I dont regret it, it was nice to vent to someone for once. The quality just wasnt there for me. I didn't expect to do it longer than a month anyways, but after looking up this app more, ive read that they train their ""therapists"" to take things slow to keep the money coming in. It certainly felt like that with the kinds of messaging I was getting. It also looks like theres a therapist shortage on their end right now, it took a while to get one to reply.

However, the service and response time has gotten awful. When they changed my dose my medication price doubled without warning. I have OptumRx prescription insurance and have requested that they transfer my prescription since my medication would cost a third of what i’m currently
paying. It’s been nearly a month since my request. They responded saying they would get back to me. Exactly 10 days later I still hadn’t heard from them so I gave them a nudge. Same response, they’ll get back to me. I told them i was nearly out of medication and asked that they refill my prescriptions once more while I wait for the transfer since I was almost out of pills. As of today I still have not gotten anywhere with this and I have less than two days of medication left. The refill hasn’t shipped nor has it even been processed. I am terrified of what will happen when I run out of medication. Withdrawals from a strong dose of antidepressants can be catastrophic. I rely heavily on the anxiety medication as well. At this point I don’t know what to do. Every time I ask for an update I get the same response: they’re looking into it and will get back to me.

The only reason I gave two stars is because they prescribed me medication that gave me my life back. Now i’m worried that i’ll be worse off than before I started the medication when I start to go through withdrawals.

I’m a very straightforward person. I told my backstory, how that effects me, and how I’d like to improve, and what type of things I expected from therapy/needed.

The first therapist was an okay person, but bad therapist.. He literally compared every “problem” of mine to a bigger problem he had once in his life. He provided no coping mechanisms. And talked like a fortune cookie. No help whatsoever. He made life sound like a sad existence that you just have to get used to... No Thanks!!

Second therapist was a young woman who just sounded really cocky after we actually talked. Like she knew everything and how to fix everything. But didn’t actually try to “fix” anything. And basically belittled me and told me what I thought was wrong and sent a passive aggressive message “proving” me wrong. 

Third one seemed like she would have been actually helpful. Helped me learn a breathing technique right away. But we didn’t really talk as much as I hoped we could. And by this point, I wasn’t really willing to waste more time and money on this app. 

As I was trying to cancel my subscription they kept offering me cheaper and cheaper deals and plans. Not sure if it was because they actually want to provide help to less fortunate people, or because they want any and all money they can get...

Either way, it would be nice if they could screen their employees before letting them actually see patients. People deserve great mental health care and I’ve seen a couple subpar therapists right off the bat. Real therapy can and should help you. And it shouldn’t be this hard to find a good therapist.

- I decided to cancel and ask for a refund after reaching out to customer service through their email and not hearing back. 
- I found their number online by some miracle and when I called, they said they were an answering service and could take a message... I asked if they had a customer service department and she gave me another number. 
- Called that number and asked for a refund. She asked a bunch of questions like the last four of my cards and the expiration but said someone ELSE would be emailing me about canceling. 

At this point I think this app has just grown too quickly without doing the work on the backend to make it a good user experience. They need better customer service training and a more intuitive app layout.

1,"I initially turned to cerebral when I needed therapy desperately, and struggled to find a therapist/psychiatrist in person who would take on new clients due to covid. I decided to go through with the subscription on here only to find out they had no available counselors and could only help me with getting medication. I proceeded with the mindset that I now only needed to look for a new therapist and could scratch a psychiatrist off the list. Terrible choice. Within the few months I've had cerebral, I've been forced to reschedule appointments with my prescriber THREE times already, and the only explanation I was provided with was ""Unforseen circumstances"". Normally I would be understanding of this, but three times is just unbelievable! Especially considering that due to this, I could not get a refill for my prescription before it ran out and went practically a week without my meds after only being on it for a month. Not to mention that your only source of communication through the app is a chat feature that could take anywhere up to 2 days to respond, and you can't even schedule an appointment until the notification pops up promoting you to do so. So if you feel you need an appointment quickly, good luck making one. I would say to anybody, take your money elsewhere and save yourself the headache. For an app that is meant to help people and provide somewhat of a safe space, they've really offered nothing but more frustration for me.",cerebral-mental-health,0.0,0.0,0.0
1,"I have been a member of cerebral for over a year. I used the service because I move around a lot and was looking for more consistency with my medication routine. At first, I couldn’t be more pleased with my service. I had a prescriber who cared and a care counselor who was useful and helped me in relevant ways. For instance, my initial prescriber went out of her way to help me get my medication at an affordable price and went so far as to call me on my personal cell phone to ensure that I was taken care of. 

Everything went down hill when that prescriber left the service. 

I have been bounced around to a new prescriber each month. This means that each month I must go over my entire medication history, relay trauma to a new person, and wait to get an appointment. Appointments with prescribers must be made two months in advance and most have very limited availability (like 10 PM EST). To be quite honest, that wouldn’t bother me too much as I was getting consistent care. 

But I’m not. 

Every month since May 2021 I have had to go a week without medication because my prescriber does not renew my prescription. Every month we go through the same routine (regardless of who my current prescriber is): I notice I have 7 pills left and message my care coordinator for a refill, three days later my care coordinator says they will contact my prescriber and let them know, after not hearing something for several days I contact again when I have one or two pills left, my care coordinator says they will contact my prescriber again and they will respond within 48 hours, I call customer service because I need medication, I go through sudden withdrawal for a day while I wait, I get my medication. 

If that wasn’t enough, I have been switched to a new medication regime with ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE from my prescriber. I was given no instructions or warning that I would be forced to go through withdrawal from my medications I had previously been on. As of right now, I have been trying to contact my “care team” for over 48 hours for hep with no response. 

The worse part of this experience is I truly, genuinely need help. I have been left in a state where I cannot stand for more than 20 minutes at a time (no shower, no driving, no cleaning, no cooking, no working). I have used every appropriate avenue available to me and have still be IGNORED by this service. 

If you’re in a situation where you are looking to use this service, please do not. I am begging you. My mental health is absolutely worse since using this service. The worst part is I am now dependent on this medication and cannot terminate usage of the service until I can get an appointment with a psychiatrist who gives a crap about me.",cerebral-mental-health,0.0,1.0,0.0

They had a person who responded through the app set me up despite it being late at night, which was cool, but I immediately spotted some pretty concerning things with their business model. I subscribed for a month, and they gave me four credits for tele-appointments. The catch is that they gave me a deadline to use those credits, which was a month from when I paid, which would be fine except that it would be almost a week in to that time before my therapist’s first available appointment time. On top of that my therapist in his first message to me said he is spending 10 days before Christmas on vacation, which leaves me wondering how I’m supposed to actual use all of these credits.

And this would all be fine, except when I tried to get a refund the automated program only offered me a partial refund (2/3 of the original fee), despite 1) only having paid a fews days prior, 2) not having any appointments scheduled and never having spoken to my therapist, and 3) not using the service in any tangible way. I contacted support, and despite being able to get a real person to help me immediately in the middle of the night to sign up, it’s been four days and I still haven’t heard back from anyone.

For those of you keeping track: a live person (or a good bot) is available immediately regardless of time of day to get you to sign up, but after they have your money the therapist will take almost a week before seeing you, and support may or may not ever get back to you.

They wouldn’t sign a paper for my school indicating I have ADD but they wanted to prescribe me. Once I said no, she told me she didn’t feel comfortable signing the paper…. Odd. You don’t want to indicate I have ADD but you’ll give me meds for it? Seemed like she didn’t want me to get what I came for and was scared I’d want to cancel afterwards. Instead, I tried to cancel because they had unethical practices and then after I emailed their cancellation email, TWICE they still charged me $83 the next month. I paid $30 + $83 for ONE session. And nope, NO REFUNDS DESPITE IF YOU USE THE SERVICES OR NOT. Still dealing with cancellation. I am a college student who’s suffering financially.

I ended up bailing because I can’t see myself doing this every single time I want access to my therapist, when we could have theoretically simply set up a regular meet time? BTW I’ve been begging them for a refund for weeks and they ignore me and my phone calls. It’s dishonest since I never received any therapy, I only received logistical messages for 400$.

1,"Give me all of my money back. I don’t write app reviews, but there is no way to get any type of response from customer service. I was a brand new paying subscriber that needed assistance with a billing/technical issue. I’ve reached out via email multiple times for a week with no response, which is valuable time and money going down the drain as I wait on customer service to respond to what should be a simple request. 
After many automated emails, I went to social media dms to try to get ahold of someone. My question could easily have been taken care of with a quick phone call but they don’t offer any type of customer service phone call. 
This has created much more stress and frustration on me, all while my paid subscription dwindles down. I was now charged for TWO different subscriptions that Im not using. You’ve been unable to assist me in a simple request so PAY ME BACK….all of it. This “partial refund” automated refund wizard thing isn’t the right approach. I never used your services, only spent time trying to figure out how to get set up correctly!
Take This Advice CS- If you don’t have enough customer service support to handle new clients, pause taking in new subscribers until you can fully serve them. Week long delays and keeping my money is not right. I’m done trying to make Talkspace work for me on my own. 
Bottom line - I’ve cancelled my account(s) and I expect Full Refunds now.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I was initially matched with a therapist that specialized in a subject that I had no issues with nor did I specify I had issues with. I had to accept in order to try to change therapists, only one of which was female (which is what I wanted) so I had to accept that.. but I felt like I wished I had more choices to pick from. My therapist was nice. Very generic though, and didn’t know how to use the platform. Promised to email me something and never did. Red flags raised when she cancelled our second appointment together but we rescheduled in the same week. I really wanted routine and continuity… and I didn’t want to switch providers at this point after already going through a really tough first appointment. So I stuck with the same provider. Fast forward, she cancelled our 4th appointment, rescheduled it for two days later, then I waited on video and she never showed up and didn’t message til the next day with a pretty tepid sorry. I called (to no avail) and emailed Talkspace to share this and show my disappointment and yes I got a refund, but no apology for being treated as unimportant or uncared for. Talkspace was my therapist’s side gig so clearly not as important as her full time job which is fine if that’s ok with you. But it took its toll on me. Will not continue. To add insult to injury, the app is not very user friendly.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I paid hundreds of dollars just for my psychiatrist to meet with me once and then to never respond to me again, despite my many attempts to contact her. She prescribed me new medication and then never once followed up on it, which was incredibly unprofessional and unsafe. I then emailed TalkSpace support, who informed me that I couldn’t get a refund, but I could get rematched and spend more money to have another initial appointment. This whole experience took about 3 or 4 months of my time that could’ve been spent getting better. I already have a hard time asking for help, and this only added frustration and exhaustion. Don’t waste your money or your time! 

UPDATE: As you can see, Talkspace responded to this review. Don’t be fooled—nothing was done after this response; it’s all for show. Many months later, I was finally able to find a psychiatrist who was committed to helping me. Upon telling her about my experience with Talkspace, she was very concerned and told me that this was extremely unsafe and could’ve been so much worse if I was in a worse place mentally. I was also misdiagnosed and given very incorrect medication, which negatively impacted my life. Please please don’t jeopardize your mental health. For an app that specializes in mental health, this is unacceptable. I am so worried for others who get tricked into using this app. This is not a safe app to use.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I’ve used this app for a few months because it’s a benefit my job provides. I am in MA and I specifically requested to be matched with a female provider. For 2 weeks, the app was only matching me with male providers. I almost gave up but finally saw 1 female provider I could choose. As we started working together, the advice I was getting was very generic, stuff you already know and can read on the internet: for ex., have you tried meditation or breathing exercises? I asked my colleagues who also use this service and they were having the same experiences. It felt like my provider was not even paying attention to half of the stuff I was saying. In the end, I switched to a real psychologist from my insurance network. It is so much more helpful than getting these generic advices over text that I can already predict the responses to. I don’t think the selection criteria to become a Talkspace provider is very high. They just train people to provide some generic responses. If you really need help and want to see progress, don’t waste your time. As for the app itself, why isn’t there an option to freeze your account for more than 1 week? Sometimes people need a longer break. And why do you even ask for gender preferences of the provider and then provide the opposite matches?",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up for this app on Saturday, searched for therapists using so many different “problems” criteria but still only ever was recommended one guy! So off the bat, there was no choice in who you work with. 😌 I messaged him on Saturday, no response, Sunday no response. (Just a hello and a clarification on my intro.) I booked him for a 10 minute free session on Tuesday morning and a one hour paid session on Thursday afternoon, figuring if he’s the only choice I can cancel Thursdays call after the Tuesday one if it’s not a good fit. I log in on Tuesday for the meeting and the meeting is gone! Had been canceled on his end, and I hadn’t been sent a notification. 😌 I messaged him to ask about it, no response. Also, my Thursday appointment said “awaiting confirmation” still as of Wednesday morning. So he’s MIA. I messaged customer service about it on Tuesday (the only contact option available on the app), and as of Wednesday morning there’s been no response from customer service either!! I messaged the therapist asking him to cancel the Thursday appointment so I don’t initiate some kind of automatic cancellation charge. I canceled my subscription. And I googled a support phone number off the app. There was no support available so I left a message. 😄 so…….. absolutely do not recommend if you need therapy lol.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app is a joke. I’ve never had any issues when my employer was paying for the membership. I no longer work for said employer, and I decided to input my insurance information to continue using this platform. It said that I had an available 45 minute session credit, but yet my provider still billed my insurance. I had to jump through hoops (DMing them on Twitter and emailing them) for Joanna to break it down to me that a “credit” is not a credit. Why would you call it a credit to mislead people? My therapist’s approach also wasn’t worth the price — I’d tell her what I’m going through, and she’d be like “that’s a lot to take in, how are you taking care of yourself?” If I knew the answers, I wouldn’t be in therapy. I refer my partner to this app, it says we both get $200, and yet my partner keeps getting billed even though they only booked 1 free 10 minute session and cancelled the other appointment. Talkspace also never said that the $200 would be paid out in credits until I emailed Joanna, and she said there was no other way for them to pay me my referral money besides credits. This is an absolute joke — run away from this. It’s not worth your time, there’s too much false advertisement and lack of accountability.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"My experience mirrors that of many other dissatisfied users. I received 
one month of unlimited messaging therapy as a gift. For over a week I checked my account and contacted customer service to see if my gift card had been applied to my account, as it did not show that on the app. Finally someone told me that it had been. At this point I’ve wasted almost two weeks. Their providers are also slow to respond and when they do, the responses seem scripted or canned. I switched providers after my first counselor only had me fill out questionnaires only to receive no feedback or fill me in on what was happening. The second counselor seemed promising & after sending her a detailed message (at her request), she finally replied that she had resigned from Talkspace and they would match me with someone else. That was over two weeks ago and the matching agent has ghosted me too. If I had not received this as a gift,  I would be more irritated because it’s expensive if you have to pay out-of-pocket. My month will expire soon and so far this app has been no help. I would even say their model seems predatory on people in vulnerable situations.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I was excited about this app because it has the chat feature so you and a therapist can communicate through text. This is a main feature if Talkspace. The two therapists I tried weren’t ready for giving care this way. Both had been counselors before they joined talk space, so maybe they were used to doing hour long therapy sessions rather than texting. The first therapist didn’t even answer me on chat, just told me we would talk about it in the appointment which I didn’t want to do, and the second one got short with me and seemed frustrated when I expressed my desire to use the texting feature. 
I just need someone to ask me questions to help me figure out what’s going on in my mind and then help me learn how to heal it. This is definitely doable with a chat feature. I am able to communicate much more honestly and learn way better this way. Maybe the therapists will get more used to this kind of communication. 

For now I recommend Noom’s Healthy Mind program if you’re like me and need to be able to text. They have coaches who know how to give care through text and so have been much more responsive and helpful in the chat.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"They aren’t transparent about their billing. I am getting charges from October and it is now February even though I had insurance that I was told “fully covered” my plan, all of these charges started rolling in when I got new insurance in January and tried to update my account. Not only that, my therapist and I met on a biweekly basis and the person who emailed me insisted their “system” shows me meeting weekly, which was simply NOT true. I can’t believe an app like this exists with this many issues. The user experience is absolutely terrible and you can’t even delete your own account? 

Anyway, I refuse to pay these bills I am getting until I can SPEAK to someone on the phone. Don’t you dare tell me to send another email. I had MULTIPLE open customer service tickets that went unanswered for weeks. But they had no problem sending me billing messages. Once I finally got a response I told them to remove my credit card information from their system and to close my account. I will make a point to tell anyone considering this app to not use it. You all are preying on people seeking help with your shady billing processes.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I’ve never done traditional therapy, but wanted to give this a try because the idea of being able to express my thoughts at anytime seemed appealing. I understood the therapist would only respond when they are working, but my experience amounted to me getting a one 30 secondish sound bite from my therapist a day. I think the concept is really cool, if it worked as intended, it would actually make therapy a lot easier for people especially those who are thinking about trying it out for the first time! But the price is pretty ridiculous to just get 1 response/day - 4x a week. Oh and I spent half of my first subscription matching because my first therapist never responded back, after I poured my heart out answering her “get to know me” questions. My advice is you can reach the same type of help you would get from Talkspace just by journaling, but if you really need help, find the time to go to a therapist. It’s actually cheaper too.. Again, great concept. Maybe some day when therapist are hired for this platform specifically and can actually deliver support rather than IG like comments on your thoughts.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I don’t normally leave reviews, but for this I just had to. I signed up with this a while back, probably about a month and a half ago. At first, I was speaking to the person who matches you to a therapist, they were responsive and helpful. then, as soon as i chose a plan, the marcher no longer responded to me. Then the waiting began. After about 2 weeks of not being matched STILL, I was concerned I was paying 300 dollars for nothing, so i reached out to their customer service. They advised me sometimes it can take a little bit to find a good therapist match for you. I am a patient person, so i thanked them for reassuring me, and continued to wait. it has now been 3 and a half additional weeks, still 0 contact from any therapists. I think if this app wants to truly work, they need way more therapists so people can get the help they need. i tried to do this virtually (therapy) as it works better for my schedule, but now i’m going to have to find something in person, as i can’t seem to be matched online.

2,"The past few weeks have been increasingly disappointing. I am in a good place in terms of my relationship with my therapist and our goals etc - but our time together during live sessions is being negatively impacted by issues with the audio where when I talk, it echoes/repeats through my speaker everything I said as if I were saying it twice in a row row your boat fashion. My therapist has reached out to support as it is not an issue only I am having and she has other clients too that are struggling with it and can’t make it through their sessions, but she is not receiving support other than being given suggestions to restart/reinstall type troubleshooting, all of which we have both already tried more than once. 

I really hope this gets fixed soon - as it is becoming a serious hinderance to the progress and focus during sessions and makes me not want to continue even at times because its too much.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"After creating a profile I was automatically set up with a therapist who had “no availability”. There is no way to pick a new therapist at this point. I reached out to customer support… 6 days later I got a response apologizing for the delay and if I still had the same issue to respond to that email? The therapist did respond and let me know she avoids showing availability but rather chats with the person to determine this… I’m sorry… using my therapy time to (billed or not) to talk schedules. I work full time, this app has a button to view availability under the guise you can schedule time… so thats just optional. The therapist also mentioned she was in a different location so it wouldn't work (insurance billing wise) like i was the one who picked her or the location. - The user experience/patient experience is sorely lacking to say the least. My employer pays for this benefit. I will be reaching out to them and asking them to not use them in the future and opt for other options that are easier for users/people seeking out therapy.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"When I first joined TalkSpace a few years back, it did wonders. I felt that that therapists genuinely cared, weren’t overbooked, and I received responses quickly. I assume in combination with the pandemic and the fact that every single podcast ever is adventuring Talkspace, it’s become incredibly over crowded, therapists are too busy (I got tossed around so many times, after not even speaking to them but receiving a message that they could not accept any more patients). I got increasingly frustrated with this and eventually deleted the app. I wanted to come back, and kept trying, but my therapists I was matched to were not helpful but instead send me paragraphs of “what to know” for well over a week before I could even tell them what I needed help with. I kept trying to be re matched but continued to encounter the same issue. Finally was matched with someone great, but she kept going on vacation! It got to the point tonight where I was just done. I’m considering paying $200 a week again for therapy, but at least it’ll be more help than this app.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Think of the bare minimum platitudes you might’ve got from a school therapist. To give you a point of reference, the selections of therapists on this app are less than half as useful as that, if they even respond to you that is. I personally went through four different therapists, two of which immediately ghosted me for two entire weeks after introductions with no scheduled vacations mentioned in the app whatsoever to prepare me for that. One therapist simply sent me a PDF file of self-help strategies and wouldn’t even let me talk to them one on one about my own personal struggles that I sought therapy for in the first place. It’s like paying 300$ a month to be gaslit into feeling like it’s your fault you aren’t getting anything out of your therapy by a bunch of automated responses that will constantly antagonize you for wanting more out of the service. I was very patient and I’m sure the individual therapists have little control over the poor system, but don’t trust Better Help.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I won’t completely diminish Talkspace because I found an incredible therapist that has been heaven sent in helping me work on my mental health. 

However, Talkspace support is absolutely terrible. The only way to reach support is via email, and responses are never returned in a timely manner. Based off my own experiences, I have had to wait at least a week or two for a response from support. Within the app, there’s also all these glitches, so during times I took a break from talkspace, I had to be re-matched to my provider all over again each time only delaying when I can start as a result. Additionally, the pricing for the services even on the most basic plan are outrageous.

I recently got a new insurance that I selected specifically because it is accepted by talkspace and I wanted to keep my therapist since she’s been amazing. Only to find out that even with a strong health care plan, I won’t be saving any money as it appears Talkspace has now nearly doubled their fees on even the most basic of services. For the most basic plan and having comprehensive insurance coverage, I am looking at nearly $350 per month which is double what I used to pay.

1,I have been dealing with postpartum rage and anxiety. I was going through a particular rough patch and was advised to find a therapist for treatment. I have twin babies and unable to get out the house so I decided to take the online route. On November 10th  I spoke with Ivanna at Talkspace that recommended I work with a therapist that specializes in maternal mental health. I was then able to find a recommended therapist named Denise Davis-Moore. I was advised Denise would respond to my message or reach out to me within 24 hours. 10 days past and I never got a response from Denise. I had also scheduled my first live online session roughly a week out and Denise never confirmed and ended up missing the session all together. I then reached out to customer support asking for a refund and they too were unresponsive. They didn’t respond until I reached out again asking for a reply to my original question.

I couldn’t even make an appointment despite having a credit, if you can’t reply to customers then maybe cater to less of them, because i genuinely need mental help and the stress of not being able to get the help i need has legitimately given me multiple mental breakdowns. I feel like I am being punished for not being able to properly communicate, one of the the very same issues I came to this app to fix. At this point it’s a whole lot easier to just continue on with my addictions and friendless life than it is to reach out for help.

I have a busy life and I lost track in the month how many I had and used. So over the three months I had it I probably missed out on at least two sessions. There is no accounting of live sessions bought or sessions booked in the app. The app does not tell you any message like, “you have 2 of 4 live sessions available”.  I feel this is underhand.  Customer service said, “Book all sessions for the month at once so you don’t miss any sessions”.  That’s great, but we have busy lives and may not have a clear schedule a month in advance. It’s almost like they don’t want to be clear how many sessions you have left and hope you don’t book all the sessions within the month so they can pocket the money.

2,"Great idea and app! Horrible quality controls, professionalism and payment transparency. Some wonderful therapists for individual and couples — overall not a professional experience.

Chat rooms, shares, audios and therapy options would be great if and only if therapists had quality control, contracts or incentives to provide professional services. 

The app itself could revolutionalize Mental Health with the right people, customer service department and reliability. It’s sad that this app is many peoples first experience with mental health due to the horrible quality controls and execution.

If Talkspace truly cares about their customers, they would have surveys about their experience with each department and fix it! There could be so many more positive reviews with the right controls and qualify service delivered.

Some therapists are wonderful! Others are unprofessional. Where is the standard? What is the service standard for professional, helpful Mental Health service?

1,"Talkspace gives you the option of texting through the week as a session, or having a one to one 45-minute session. However Talkspace does not differentiate between messages about the mechanics of the sessions and actual therapy messages. So when your therapist messages you to do an assessment before your session, that counts as texting. When your therapist sends you a bunch of handouts or files, that counts as a session. 

In my case, I was authorized 5 sessions through my EAP, and was billed for two sessions for each of the two weeks, and then even though the therapist could see I still had another session, all of my future appointments were cancelled. My only recourse was to send an email, which I was told had a typical response time of 4-6 weeks. 

I’ve filed a formal complaint with the EAP and my HR, as it’s their money that is being wasted. I wouldn’t recommend anyone use this provider until they can stop their predatory billing practices.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

When I saw the promises made by this app I had some hope to be matched and start talking to someone (honestly anyone). They said it would be 48 hours to be matched with a provider….it took closer to 72, but that’s okay because they sent an email saying they were busier than normal after I signed up. That’s forgivable because FINALLY I have a match! …silence, so I initiated the conversation and then several hours later got a generic response on how the app works and “tell me why you are here, I am logging off today but I’ll respond tomorrow”. Great, so I give my background. That was 3 business days ago, (and a weekend) and I have messaged every day and still no response.

Unfortunately, it’s completely impossible to get in touch with anyone at Talkspace to send a bill for reimbursement. 

Our therapist asked them over and over again to please respond to me, but other than a brief “we’re sorry you’ve been having a hard time!” email, no one has provided us with the bill we need for reimbursement. There is no live chat or number to call, which is pretty astounding in 2021.

Now I’ve just been no-showed on my 30-minute session despite her confirming early in the week that we had a call scheduled. I’ve been on this app for almost 2 months and haven’t even had a full appointment. Both therapists were very nice but apparently they all neglect to show up for sessions on time/at all.

I only received one email back from “Amber” with no phone number or contact information and have not heard back regarding my refund request. I have reached out to the psychologist “Judith” that never confirmed either of the 2 appointments I scheduled with her and never responded to my message regarding this issue. Talk space is HORRIBLE!

However, once I started the matching process, it went downhill from there. First of all, all of the matches were the opposite gender from what I requested. I wrote back and was told that these were the only ones available, so I decided to try one. I finally chose the one who had the soonest appointment available, but the therapist never confirmed my appointment, and it was cancelled. I tried again to find an appointment that was sooner, and I was told by another matching agent that I had scrolled through all of the available doctors. I have since canceled the service and requested a refund.

I asked customer support if they could refund me my $200 since I did not benefit anything from this app, the service is not what I paid for. They said they’d refund $90 so I was fine with that. They never responded/issued my refund. I kept responding in the same ticket about my refund, no response. I created a new ticket and they closed it without even a response.

1,"I have been actively trying to get matched with a therapist for over a month and continue to be ping ponged around in their broken systems.

Talkspace’s process is riddled with problems and promises features that it fails to deliver. From IT issues to incompetent customer support representatives that give you the runaround this ordeal has been taxing at best. 

The “provider match service” only provides you one option and when you try to book an appointment it loops you through an infinite sign in process.

Many people struggle with mustering the energy to seek mental health services. Their broken system adds additional frustration and mental fatigue.

My work provides me a series of free sessions but I ended up signing up with Alma instead. With Alma I was able to contact a provider within 24 hours. 

Let me re-state that— even with FREE SESSIONS Talkspace’s system is so broken that I am choosing to go to another service and pay for a provider. I could not imagine how furious I would be if I had to pay to get this runaround. 

If you have struggled to seek mental health care and you are taking that first step to find a provider: It is so hard to seek help and I am so proud of you for trying to navigate this. Please seek another service so you won’t be discouraged from seeking help. This runaround is not normal.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"After doing TalkSpace last year, I keep thinking about therapy and how I’ll probably likely never do it again after my experience with these guys. After a few sessions, I got told that this isn’t really supposed to be a chat app, but more of a way for me to be told some helpful things to do everyday that might make me more “balanced” and “happy”. Basically I didn’t feel like I could actually get anything off my chest or speak about a bad day because all my therapist would do was send me daily tasks like write what makes me thankful. I think those things are important to incorporate, but it just made me more upset. I stopped responding after maybe a week of this and lost out on my money because I paid for a month of service.

The intent behind the app is good what with being anxious and not wanting to go into talk to someone, but I just had a really bad experience.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The platform, process, introduction, and orientation  are very appealing initially, but after multiple therapists who No-Showed on meetings, didn’t respond to messages ever (talk space has a “guaranteed response window”… pfft!), and being charged my account/ insurance without any response from customer service, I cancelled my membership and took it as a life lesson. It’s unfortunate that the company would be so reckless with individual’s mental health and those seeking alternative guidance in the world today. I’m sure I could’ve cycled through therapists and tossed away money until eventually landing on a good therapist, but if TalkSpace doesn’t care then why should I try. Very disappointing! If someone is seriously seeking betterment in their life with convenience, there are responsible apps out there. I switched a few weeks ago and it’s amazing! Someone should tell Michael Phelps about what he’s putting his name on.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"If you plan on using an HSA card to pay, DON’T DO IT! I have been waiting and waiting for a super bill because my HSA is requiring verification, and a regular old invoice or receipt isn’t what they want. I have requested this super bill multiple times, only to be met with the same automated response. I provide the information they’re asking for, then I never get another response. I’m on my third or fourth request for a super bill for my first month, and in the mean time Talkspace hit my card for another $280, so now my HSA wants verification for that too. This company shouldn’t be advertising how they accept HSA if they aren’t willing to provide the verification HSA needs in a timely manner. I liked my therapist but unfortunately I will not be continuing with Talkspace due to their poor customer support.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I should have known something was wrong when I tried to get ahold of customer service for a billing issue. Still haven’t heard back a week later. Resolved the issue myself but now I can’t get ahold of either therapist I matched with and apparently I don’t actually get the 1 session a week I paid for. Unfortunately for me I paid 3 months in advance (over $1,000) and there doesn’t seem to be any way to get my money back other than claiming fraud with my bank. I think it’s a good concept but they clearly don’t have the manpower at the moment to make it work. For how much they charge they should at least have a customer service phone number…but no just automated responses to your messages and no accountability. Hopefully your reading these reviews instead of seeing the App Store rating and purchasing this service like I did.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"This review is focused primarily on the platform itself. I found getting started to be a clunky process. I had signed up for a plan that included a weekly live session. My first 3 therapists that I was connected with did not have availability for live sessions. Once I found a therapist that did have live sessions, the times I requested for live sessions always had to be moved as they conflicted with a session she already had scheduled. 

Ultimately, this platform is not right for me. I signed up while I was in the midst of a major depression and wish I'd recognized that not having a dedicated session time more frequently wasn't going to work. An expensive mistake as I signed up for a quarter. The therapist I landed on would have been a great fit on another platform, but I'm going to cut my losses.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"As with everything else in US healthcare, it’s profit-center disguised as empathy and compassion. 
I recently had my existing therapist switch firms, and unfortunately they were no longer able to take my employer health insurance. I’ve been unable to find anyone in the months since.
I was recommended to check out Talkspace from a friend, and my first question is actually google’s most common search: “Does Talkspace accept insurance?”
The answer that Talkspace uses is “40 million Americans have their Talkspace covered by their insurance or employer.”
In fact, there’s a prompt for it in the settings with drop down menus to all of the health insurance plans available in the country. Something seemed fishy though, as I couldn’t progress any further.
When I talked to my “match specialist,” I was told “We generally don’t accept insurance.”

If a company is going to be this deceptive and dishonest with its messaging before I’ve even started, what does that say about their ethics?
“40 million Americans have their Talkspace covered by their insurance or employer” doesn’t exactly scream “we generally don’t accept insurance,” does it?",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The app takes weeks to match you to a provider but they still run the clock on your credits so your sessions expire. Providers have no availability so you pay for a month and can’t use your sessions. Have not heard back from customer support in TWO WEEKS. There is no phone support, only email that goes into a black hole. One provider missed my video session and then tried to force me to use chat only. Another provider is ignoring my requests to reschedule even though I brought it up at my last session. The app does not give you a way to reschedule nor cancel a session yourself. When you go to the session details page it is blank even on a new iPhone with latest iOS. The only way to reschedule or cancel a session is through your provider. Which you can’t do if they won’t respond.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Be careful. They say they take insurance but no you create an account and it says it will look at your insurance and then work with your insurance company. Lies. Got two bills very large and it was ridiculous. Our insurance covers mental health and pays for counseling. They did not charge insurance at all. Then when you try to check the insurance, it makes you upload the information again but it wants you to make a new account. If you put a in a request it takes forever to hear back from still in the process. All I can say is be wary of this app and the fact that it “takes insurance”. Very disappointed!

Please do not say send feedback to the email address and we will respond in one day because this is a lie. If it were true then you would have responded to our support issue in the first place…",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Unless you are ready to book that day, and luckily run into no issues, maybe it won’t matter that there’s no customer service hotline, and all customer service tickets are handled by bots. 

I tried to use their service for the first time, didn’t hear back from my matched provider for 5 days because she was out on vacation. (Why did they match me with someone not even available?) She won’t be free for another week!  The plan I chose was 4 sessions for the month, this means you have 4 credits you HAVE to use within a 4 week period. You get no refunds. Not just prorated refunds, but I haven’t spoken to anyone yet and already I want to cancel but there is NO option to if you change your mind. I’m now scrambling trying to squeeze 4 sessions within a 2.5 week period because this app is stupid.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I tried three different therapists and none of them helped at all. I had a partner recently passed away due to a traumatic accident and was not given any real tools to work on my PTSD, but instead was chocked up to “stages of grief”. They never checked in and do not really care about your well being, it’s just an extra paycheck to them as most have in person clients already. They honestly don’t seem to know what they are doing. Most don’t even know how to work the app. I was charged for a full session and we did nothing. The entire time the therapist was trying to figure out how to do live messaging. We both messaged the help center and I didn’t hear back for two weeks…how is that helpful? My takeaway is this app is a waste of time and money full of mediocre therapists looking for quick cash.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Waited over a month at this point to get my situation fixed. Once I ran out my 5 free sessions with a therapist, I set up my payment method to continue therapy. But it still said i have no credits available, so I can’t book more therapy sessions.

 I messaged support three times within 3 weeks about this issue and no response. Once I did get a response they said they fixed the issue and closed my ticket without confirming it was fixed. Lowe and behold, the issue is not fixed and I still can’t add credits for sessions. So now I’ve been waiting 2 more weeks after having to make a new support ticket in order to get another response. 5 weeks now and still no therapy for me. Doesn’t seem like they care about me or my mental health at all. I’ll be going to BetterHelp from now on.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I started their services because i was in dire need of help. I filled out my insurance information and everything, took their little survey’s and they matched me with a provider. I started messaging her right away and didn’t get a response for a day. Cool no big deal at least she responded. As SOON as she sent the message the next day, i sent in a reply and then nothing. For two days. Not to mention i said i was suicidal and to not get a reply from her after stating that i was having issues was beyond frustrating. She never answered so i cancelled my account. Don’t waste your time on this app, go to better help instead or work on getting a therapist through your insurance. Seems like all this app and their providers care about is milking the clock to get more money. Biggest waste of my time.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I just read the other reviews. So many of us were robbed. I’m down for taking legal action if anyone else is?
 I wasn’t matched for with a therapist for almost a week and when I did match, they immediately took $396 dollars without any approval on the provider. 
The therapist had 1 year experience, and apologized that she didn’t have experience with the one thing I signed up for. 
We parted ways nicely via one text. 
The app is too busy and basic to provide actual health care. I asked for a refund (and it’s not easy to get) and they kept 100$ of the refund. It sounds like a good idea, but it’s just an expensive experiment. I never had a single session or a talk: Lost $100 bucks?! No one returns my emails. I have to dispute the charges with my CC now. They only exist to take money from people who need help.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Is therapy supposed to be frustrating? Are you supposed to have to spend more time communicating with customer service than talking to your therapist? If the answers to the above were yes, this would be the best service ever. My therapist continually cancelled my appointments (she cancelled 3 out of 4) with her, so I only got to talk to her once. When I tried to get assigned to a new therapist, they were unable to find one for me. Their system registers any messages sent as sessions too, so I made sure not to send any messages and only use live sessions. The issue is that my therapist was constantly sending messages. Even though I didn’t respond to them, Talkspace still credited them against my account as sessions. Such a rip off…added stress to my life when I was looking for tools to reduce stress.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up for talk space as I have been unsuccessful with other types of therapy in the past, and it is hard for me to fit anything more in my schedule. I went through the initial stages is signing up and selected a provider based on their recommendations (bots), signed all the intake forms and never got a response after waiting almost a full week. This is after messaging the provider to see if she had the capacity to take me on as a client after I had waited a few days for a response. It is not what is advertised, which is sad because I thought this would be a good avenue for someone with my crazy schedule. I canceled my subscription and requested a refund cause let’s face it I didn’t actually use their service, but after requesting a refund was only able to get the partial amount.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I was referred by my mom's work to get this as it is covered under her insurance plan. They basically offered a free trial, but once that was over, it became ridiculously difficult to make an insurance claim. I really like my therapist, but I might have to find a new one because the full service costs about $100 per week. I could be wrong about the exact cost, I don't care. It's too expensive to pay for without insurance. I can't get the app to take my insurance, which does cover the service. Customer support does not have a phone number, you just have to send a message and hope that someone responds within the week. 

I've seen reviews here of people unsatisfied with their therapists, but I think the service itself is the problem. Absolutely laughable cash grab.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Three different therapists. Three terrible experiences. 
The first therapist that I was paired with was a very kind lady. Her profile s said she was new to talkspace. Even with that fact…I thought I’d give it a try. After 2 weeks of very slow (copy and paste) textbook responses, I decided to try a different therapist. 
Second therapist after only 3 or so hours decided that I had a substance abuse issue. Hadn’t asked me any detailed questions about me or my life yet. Not sure how someone could come to that conclusion via text after just a basic first
Interaction. 
Third therapist. Even with my prior experiences I went in with a positive attitude. I didn’t take my frustrations out on her. What made up my mind to walk about from talkspace was what happened next. I sent a message on a Tuesday sharing my bad experiences so far and I was thinking about walking away, and it being a waste of money. Third therapist didn’t even look at it or respond until Sunday! 
Maybe whoever reads this will have a better experience than I did. Maybe not. That’s for your to decide. I’m just one person telling lots
Of people that it’s not worth the money or time.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"Perhaps it’s me, but it seems like the therapists are just answering with an automated messages and more evaluations, which I just completed. She states she wants to know my story, which I put allot of effort in and then you get these automated messages back. I will try a face to face therapist now.
Also if you try to cancel your subscription you will be asked 8, yes 8!!!! Times if you are sure you want to cancel, I mean this is insane. If you want to cancel, you should be able to do this without being asked 8 times if you are sure and trying to lure people in. Again, this could be just me thinking this, but I will leave it here for the world to read.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Talkspace provides a virtual platform to connect with therapists for mental health which is awesome. What’s not awesome is their customer support team. I was told my plan would expire in 2023 after some confusion about it ending prior. Then my plan is canceled without my prompting and I’m told I was given incorrect information. This is so incredibly frustrating considering it is my main support for positive mental health. I’m extremely disappointed and upset that I won’t be able to continue. Their support team frequently takes a week or longer to reply, and this would happen with some of their providers as well. It seems like an environment that doesn’t support growth on either end. What a shame when the potential is so great!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I wonder if Talkspace actually looks into the people providing care. I know they don’t respond to complaints or concerns so I doubt it. My therapist never responded to me even on days when we had a session or she cancelled a session. There was no daily interaction or daily assistance. 

I saw my provider twice before she started cancelling last minute and I was never given the ability to reschedule so I paid for 4 sessions and only received half with no way to reschedule or get a refund. The second month I was charged and had 0/4 sessions due to last minute cancellations. Still limited help from Talkspace with automatically generated responses. I have filed with the better business bureau. Perhaps then I will get a response?",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The builders should be ashamed of themselves. With all the mental health issues going on right now, they are stealing from people who are seeking help. Despicable!!!!! 

1. They force you to prepay for sessions before you use them. 

2. They pair you up with a therapist on their own. No choice on your end but request another. 

3. My therapist canceled twice on me an hour before my appointment citing bad scheduling! 

4. After 2 weeks of trying to schedule and the crap customer experience I attempted to cancel.

5. The cancellation system forces you to cancel your account  first so you lose access to customer service and the app, then you have to click on a link emailed to you to request a refund.

6. Refund process goes like this - click on link, you get offered a refund! Great no amount shows and you click accept the which another pop up comes up with “confirmation” so if you quick click “ok” and NOT NOTICE THAT ITS HALF WHAT YOU PAID FOR! That’s it! No recourse no support nothing!!!

1,"The app really doesn’t feel like it is made to help people. I bought four sessions but the credits for sessions expires after four weeks, so if you can’t find a good time to talk with your therapist, you lose your money, and fork it over to the company instead.

Once you talk to your therapist, the clock starts to tick. If your therapist have a limited availability or go on a vacation, you are going have to keep pushing the meeting back, but when you do that, you have to forfeit your expired credits and buy new sessions.

One credit gets you one session that you have spend in a week. This feature is a pure money grab. It causes lots of unnecessary stress than actually helping.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up to speak with a therapist who was scheduled 2 weeks out. Two days before the initial appointment I was just ghosted. Talkspace said the therapist never confirmed my appointment though I received several assessments that I spent time completing. Then I received a notice from Talkspace that they were canceling my account because I hadn’t selected a new therapist in time. I reached out to support, who sent me a message 5 days later saying they’d had a high volume of requests that were all pretty much resolved and to resubmit my request if it was still pending. At that point I elected not to move forward with Talkspace anymore. It sounded like a convenient app but has been nothing but headaches.

Well life throws us curve balls and i decided to redownload the software and try the live sessions. Everything seemed normal, until i have not been matched with a provider, still stuck with a matching provider who i am now believing has quit, or moved on to something different. So i find myself stuck, cant get matched with a therapist, all my old messages i can go back and read, and im paying a subscription that i am not receiving any time to even talk to anyone!

2,"If you want actual affordable therapy, use Cerebral. 
If you want overpriced journaling, use Talkspace.
The support for the app is poor. Cost is high for limited packages. In my experience it’s more expensive than in person therapy and I find I much prefer in person to this format. Video sessions are 30 minutes. The prices packages with one or more video session are higher, and while you can add more video time, I consider the video options cost prohibitive. I feel like I paid quite a lot to write a journal that someone kind of reads, and might respond to. It might work well for some. My preference is still in person or remote session therapy.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up for talkspace hopeful for mental health help on a tight schedule. My therapist told me she was over booked and discharging clients before I even filled my intake paperwork out. She did not schedule my one on one until the day the second month charges would go through. I cancelled the membership and found out this is not FSA eligible as advertised because it is considered  a monthly subscription service. So I basically forked out a month of payment I thought was coming from my FSA, but instead had to use my personal account and got no services delivered. Contacted support multiple times and they were slow to respond and not helpful or apologetic about the situation. I highly recommend against this app.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Bought a month subscription and was optimistic about this given reviews, however my first appointment was canceled shortly after I booked it (which is fine, it was a holiday weekend). Second appointment booked a couple of weeks later and I logged in, however my therapist had problems connecting and canceled on me again. No alternative proposed (text chat was clearly working through the app) and now I’m still looking at a calendar trying to get in.

When I tried to find a new one I was notified that there were no more matches. I opened a case and from the customer service representative’s message it was obvious that they didn’t even read my message.

And they will bill you for those sessions that you’ve never attended and there’s no way to get a refund until (ha) you contact customer service to get a response because by then, it will have been too long since your session that never happened.

The therapist stopped responding to texts (this is not bombarding, rather making daily observation about issues and mental status) and then she no-showed for our second session. No notification, no apology, just ghosted. Zero professionalism. Talkspace offered a refund of $109 out of $436 I paid, I declined and requested $316, not a full refund as I was willing to compensate the therapist for the time she did dedicate, but Talkspace hasn’t responded.

I scheduled with a new therapist who then didn’t have any availability until the last 2 weeks of my billing period, so I had to cram 4 sessions into 2 weeks. Way more anxiety than therapy.

1,"I spent a week fruitlessly trying to find a provider to work with on this app. 

Their automatic match connected me with someone in the Midwest who was completely inappropriate for the issues I’m dealing with. The one halfway okay match told me flat out that she doesn’t want to work with me. 

Their matching system asks about the areas you want to work on — it does NOT list all the areas that their FAQ claims they specialize in, btw, LGBQTIA is notably missing — then modifies them to other issues, which may or may not be related, or completely ignores them. 

I contacted support to ask for help with matching as their system wasn’t working. The first response took several days to tell me how to search for a new match — something that I’d obviously done already by my message. The second response said to wait another week and try again to see if more therapists are added for my area. 

So, yeah. When you’re selling time based subscription services that you can’t provide, I can see why delaying would be you’re preferred troubleshooting step. 

So shady.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

When I speak to my insurance provider they can see the recent claims from Talkspace and I do have coverage to use them, but every time my therapist or I try to book a session there’s always an issue. When I try to reach out to support there’s no use, it’s always an automated response and on top of that, the response is a week after I sent the original email.

I got connected pretty to my therapist quickly unlike the other reviews. But trying to book a time with her just yields endless loading screens and white screens.

Then when I tried to talk to them about the bills they ignored me until it was due and I had to pay before it went to collections.

The next day, I get a notice that she’s suddenly on vacation for 10 days and the day after that, I get a notice she is no longer on Talkspace.

Second psychiatrist I messaged him and said my therapist believes I should get tested for adhd. He told me to make an appointment so I did. That appointment lasted 5 minutes and consisted of him telling me he can’t help me…..okay I understand, but you couldn’t have told me that when I messaged him on the first place?

Have not heard back from anyone and it’s been over a week. Also, The therapist that I worked with was incredibly unprofessional.

I swear it’s just a bots in customer support because they clearly never read your message and never answer your questions.

Then when I got different insurance I again reached out to customer service and after waiting several weeks for a response I received a reply that was generic and not at all related to the questions I had asked. 
It is as if customer service does not even read or take the time to comprehend customers issues before cutting & pasting generic replies.
If they even bother to reply to this review I suspect it will also be generic and not respond to my complaints",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Customer Support: 100% Non-existent. An “automated” refund wizard is buggy and useless. Accepts Health Insurance: They pretend to, but don’t. Rather they trick you into thinking their services will be covered by your health insurance and then bill your card without consent. Experienced therapists: They don’t share therapists backgrounds or credentials, so who knows. It’s sad to see an organization pretending to address mental health by ripping off those seeking help for mental illness. Michael Phelps should disassociate from this racket, and Apple should remove it from the app store. I would hope others have considered reporting their experience to the NY AG fraud department. Edit: Don’t be fooled by their sympathetic reply to this. They have 0 support. 0 replies.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I tried this as it is included with my insurance, but I cannot believe that a company is trying to profit off of much needed mental health services like this. 

You need to let patients select their therapist. It is insane that providers are randomly assigned to people. I requested a provider with experience handling PTSD and depression and got a new graduate who specializes in anxiety. Then the plan cancellation requires me to rate them even if we haven’t had a session. I gave a 5 stars to the provider as it’s not their fault the technology isn’t working, however the cancellation reasons then only allow you to select tech issues or some variety of blame on the provider. Absolutely insane.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Very poor customer service!

I am a resident doctor who needed someone to talk to after going through the Covid pandemic after being surrounded by death and sorrow for a year. Despite what people think, residents actually don’t make very much money at all. 

I am, however, eligible to get reimbursed for my mental health expenses from my hospital if I send them some basic information about the therapy that I’m receiving (things like diagnosis, therapist information, etc…)

I contacted customer service multiple times, and they would never contact me back! I just got my first reply since October (4 months ago!) The problem still isn’t resolved, and I’m spending what little money I have out of pocket on my mental health because of their poor customer service.

There is no way to call, you can only send text messages through the app and you will not get a response. Not only is the Talkspace customer service abysmal, but they should truly be ashamed of themselves. They are doing active harm to people.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"DON’T SAY YOU WEREN’T WARNED!

This is a terrible app! Definitely do not download it…. Go and get a real therapist!

They make you pay hundreds of dollars upfront and then you get matched with therapists who aren’t even specifically what you were looking for. In our case this was simply couples therapy… not exactly an uncommon need. They managed to produce only 3 therapists!

Worse still, after being charged around $300 for the month of October, (which would renew in November), I then found out my therapist couldn’t even have an introductory call with me until January 2022!!!

Oh and it gets worse. When I then tried to raise this with customer support, they just ignored me until 3 days later when they finally responded after numerous attempts to contact them. All in all it took about a week to get my money back.

If somebody was suffering from severe anxiety, stress or depression, I would go as far as saying this useless app could actually cost lives. It should be banned from the App Store!

1,"I think this is the only time I’ve ever left a review for an app in 10 years of having an iPhone.  The therapists cancel appointments on the same day with no explanation.  They talk more than they listen. They waste the entire session. And then if you actually need support from the company you literally never get a response. I sent in 5 different support requests over the span of 7 days and not one of them got a response.  I finally had to delete the app.  I paid $500+ for one month of service and got literally no help at all.  A complete waste of time, zero support, zero help.  A total waste.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"My therapist just sent me workbooks and pamphlets to “help” me with my problems. She was incredibly hands off. After trying to find another female therapist, the app kept recommending male therapists until eventually it directed me to the matching agent. I didn’t really want to wait around and waste even more money so I cancelled my subscription and received 3/4 of my money back. I truly felt like I was robbed. I thought that this would be a good place to have a back and forth conversation with someone, but I could have gotten the materials she gave me from Google… for free. I only wish there was a free trial period so that I could have saved that money for real therapy.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I never leave reviews but I’m so dissatisfied with this service that I have to help other people. 

Do not spend a large amount of money on this service. I paid 430 dollars for a monthly subscription and it’s close to the end of the month and I received no help. My therapist hasn’t looked at my messages. So I reached out to customer support and they sent me an automated message about a refund and I clicked the link and the system told me that I was not eligible for a refund. There’s no number to call to speak with a person either. The entire operation is sketchy. 

Please please please consider another service until these people get it together.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I was excited to try Talkspace when my company offered the service. Now after being on Talkspace for a month I am disgusted by this service. My company plan provides 1 live session a month. When you first sign up you get a 10 min live consultation. My provider cancelled 5 mins before because she had a family emergency. She said it would come back so I could rebook but my free consultation was never reimbursed. 
Then I booked my 30 min live session with her. She did not show up or answer any of my messages asking where she was. 

I reached out to Talkspace a week ago asking for a new provider and a reimbursement of my live session that I lost because she didn’t show up.
They have still not responded to my ticket. 

For a company that is supposed to be helping people I am disturbed that they are making it so hard to get help. I am currently in the process of speaking with my company about the potential of them changing services from Talkspace.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"You login, there’s a multi-step process to sign up. Mind you, people seeking out this app probably aren’t in the best place to fill in a form and verify their email address. Then you get directed to a traffic controller that doesn’t respond immediately and you can wait up to an hour before getting contacted by even a person to help, let alone a licensed therapist. Take it off the market, Apple. It’s even more shameful because this app is supposed to help people in need. You think those that download an app blinking tears away are going to deal with this? I hope not, they deserve better.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

They just send you resources and never reply even when you try to send a message back. You can't get past the screen, so you're stuck there. This is extremely insensitive. I don't really understand how the value is to make therapy easy and affordable. They only partner with three insurance plans, and if you're not one of them, they're like, oh, we only work with self paid clients. They don't even TRY to understand your situation, I'm actually wondering if we're talking to humans or robots.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

Basically I’ve been in the service for a month and a half and paid for 8 sessions but I only have 3 left, but they expire, but I’ve only had 2 initial conversations goodbye 900 ( I think I got a refund of 100?).

2,"It’s a bit dangerous to offer a therapist / a way of talking to someone about your mental health issues only for that therapist to ignore your messages. 

When that happened the app suggested a new therapist that had nothing to do with my mental health issue and then I was told there were no other therapists nearby (I live in a major metropolitan city).

1,I tried TalkSpace when they first started and was immediately matched to an amazing therapist who really helped me overcome my GAD and PTSD. I have been having difficulty since then and decided to try talk therapy again. This app unfortunately has went down the drain and it’s unfortunate to someone who may be starting out with therapy and incredibly discouraging. I encourage those of you to seek in person help as this app is NOT going to give you what you’re looking for. As another user discussed they offer a pro-rate refund and charge you BEFORE you even see a therapist while they claim you won’t be.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,They give you a person you know nothing about just the first name and that they are certified And give automated responses but have to pour your heart out just to get an  automatic response from a stranger that doesn’t really care.

It adds to your frustration and low levels of energy when you’re going through something for which you’ve approached a therapist in the first place! Moreover, despite spending time in articulating and typing the problem that you’re going through, there are questions the therapist asked which were just paraphrased differently than the ones asked previously!

Here I am at the end of February 13th, and I haven’t even received a reply… I also haven’t been paired with an actual therapist. The worst part is the lack of communication from Talkspace.

On top of that providers are hit or miss. I had one good provider, but another one that was completely unprofessional, spending time talking about his personal life and veering off topic onto unrelated subjects. The good providers get booked out so more than likely you will find you’re getting matched with someone who is not great.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I love the purpose of this app and the support it provides. I love that a lot of jobs offer it as a benefit. However I am deeply saddened to leave a discouraging review. As a platform in the mental health space to have such a plethora of software glitches is grossly negligence. As a software engineer myself I am horrified at the amount and brevity of the bugs in the application. It is also severely irresponsible to not offer technical phone support with the full knowledge of the vulnerabilities your system has and otherwise especially being in this space ! Please do better. We all need you to. Thank you,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

After explaining further that their providers negligence was unacceptable, they pointed me to another FAQ page about switching providers. I immediately cancelled my account and told them off.

No one in support to call and talk to,  no recourse except to email these clowns every other day asking for a receipt, and everyday the silence continues.

1,"WARNING: if you use this app you are one back away from all your therapy notes being accessed and shared with the world. TalkSpace says federal law requires them to keep it but this is most likely a lie, as they are incentivized to keep the chats so that you can easily return as a customer. At the least, they should allow you to have all transcripts stored offline rather than in the cloud as they are currently stored today.

1,I was using EAP to cover the sessions and every time I schedule with my therapist in the chat (the only way I have to contact them) I am charged one of my sessions. The first time this happened it took customer service 16 days to respond to my ticket and reverse the charge. This time it took over 3 weeks for a response and they didn't even understand what the problem was so nothing was fixed. Talkspace charged me for a session that never happened. I have no idea how long it will take for me to get another response.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I’m a little upset at what they did with this app. I had TalkSpace way before you had to pay to speak with therapists. This app used to be free and able to communicate with a whole community of people who have or are going through the same thing you are. It was a great platform I would interact with people. I come back after awhile and now I gotta pay to speak with therapists.

Now I lost all that…,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

I even asked one to respond if they didn’t want me as their patient like I didn’t care but they didn’t, they just read my message and did not confirm an appointment time.

Not once did my therapist assist me and standing up for myself. Never oneRecommended domestic hotline for abused women. What is the counseling for? Is it so I do not report the crime?

It took days for my therapist to respond to my pretty short paragraph and she never said anything remotely helpful. Always a brief question and then poof she’s gone again for a couple days! I stopped responding because it’s not helping it’s just venting at that point. There’s no real interaction going on she might as well be an AI. It’s terrible and useless.

1,The earliest appointment the therapist had was three weeks out. Waited this long to be notified that he never confirmed so it automatically cancelled the appointment. Frustrating and cancelled my subscription. Just before this I signed up with Betterhelp and after choosing a therapist and Waiting two weeks he said he was leaving the platform.

For an example: (1) once I got matched my therapist asked me introduce myself before any meeting prior, I got charged. (2) She asked me what is the best time to schedule our first appointment. I got charged again.

This happened multiple times when our “sessions” were all administrative (and normally just one message).  After reaching out to support to revise my account, their advice was to talk to them about it during a call session…The reason I wanted to start therapy was because I had terrible postpartum depression and anxiety and felt like I didn’t have any time for myself so I kept having to reschedule with a newborn. So I guess the advice was really to just ignore your therapist if they reach out to you about meeting?

1,Abigail on customer support was no help whatsoever and to top it off they charge you everything at once without telling you exactly what insurance covers. They make it out to be like insurance covers the whole cost. At that point you should just pay for an in person therapist. Not worth it at all. Go elsewhere.

By the time that I match with another therapist, it would be another week or so for their availability then the therapist never confirm the appt and it was automatically cancelled. Then they matched me with another therapist who has no availability. I just don’t have time to go back and forth.

1,I signed up for the couples therapy and we supposed to be match with a therapist. We were 16 days in and nothing. I entered several tickets and final someone responded me 7 days later apologizing for delay and offered me 25% discount! Is this a joke ?! I want the full $400 that I paid out of pocket.

Not only did my provider not respond for nearly 72 hours (and she never did) but when I reached out to customer support they also did not respond for over 24 hours. They only auto-responded when I emailed for a refund. The best part — you denied me a full refund because I didn’t do so in 48 hours… because I was waiting for someone, literally anyone, to respond through Talkspace. Awful app.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I’ve been on TalkSpace for almost three years, and once my mental health is in a better place, I’m running away from TalkSpace.

My reasons: They have violated my HIPAA rights twice. Their customer support is unreachable by phone and is incredibly slow—it took three months to resolve a billing dispute. They do not allow clinicians to offer support for clients taking leave from work due to their mental health.

In short. My therapist has been there to the extent TalkSpace allows her to be. The business TalkSpace has not supported me.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

I have been ignored by customer support for 9 days now, I have never spoke with a provider and they charged my card.  I tried to use the refund wizard and surprise - I can only get $96 back.

If this issue isn’t resolved I will be reaching out to the better business bureaus to report them as a scam and for theft.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"You have to paid to get matched with a therapist. Once I did, my therapist wasn’t free for a month. I tried to cancel but was only offered 75% refund even though it was only 3 days and I used no service. It gave me an option to contact support and plead my case. It took them a week to get back to me and they said they wouldn’t give me a full refund. I went to get my refund and it went down to 50% because it took them so long to respond.

I originally used Talkspace a few years back. It was great and my provider really helped me. In reaching back out, I had  difficulty finding a provider that would actually respond timely.

It was a complete waste of money… and it’s a lot of money to waste.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

I took any assessment that I was prompted and still never heard anything.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app is a scam. Can I please just get a refund? I’ve spent weeks being matched with multiple different “care providers” and none of them actually take appointments. I am paying hundreds of dollars for video sessions that are expiring because YOUR therapists aren’t taking appointments.

I need a refund or a therapist that’s actually gonna help me. I am reporting this to the BBB and any other healthcare governing body I can find. If talkspace has SCAMMED YOU TOO? I encourage you to:

REPORT THEM to the BBB & SAMHSA!!

It is so unethical to take mentally ill people’s money while they’re already struggling and give them nothing in return.

1,"I used to love TalkSpace but after coming back recently I had a billing issue and could not get customer support to respond to me.

Also the availability and options for providers is much more limited than it used to be. Maybe it’s because I moved to a new state but it just feels like this app has declined.

1,Someone is getting rich off of this ridiculous app and it’s a shame because they could actually have platform to help people. Expect to ask questions and receive copy and pasted responses you can find on any search engine. This app is definitely not worth nearly what they charge.

1,"On my 2nd therapist and my first seemed like she was new to the field. Her responses were swift but not necessarily helpful. She quit on me after taking a very long break. Told to find someone else which I did. Now, after only a few basic messages…already not responding in time. I don’t see how this is helpful to someone like me who has severe depression and anxiety. It’s hard enough finding someone and this is why people end up giving up on therapy…",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

Don’t use Talkspace if you need itemized receipts for reimbursement from your HSA or likewise. You have to send in a request to get it every month. They haven’t responded to my support tickets since JUNE, so I am out over $1000 due to not being able to submit for reimbursement.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I have used Talkspace since May. My therapist was good. The customer support is so bad that it’s more frustrating to use this app then it is worth. I can’t get my itemized bill for reimbursement for the last 3 months. I have sent in several requests and I get the same 7-10 business day response. I have yet to receive anything. I think they just have an auto response and no one actually helps you. It’s a joke. I’m out 1200 dollars and am so frustrated, I need therapy to recover. 

There’s also no number to actually talk to a live person.

I work in the medic field and emailing a super bill is so easy, so it’s hard for me to understand why they can’t get mine to me.

Pretty terrible stuff from a mental health app lol",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Takes days for a therapist to respond and when they do it doesn’t seem to be anything helpful. More like just providing sympathy than therapy. I’ve had two therapists so far. First wasn’t too bad but didn’t seem to fit my needs so I tried another and she would respond once a week. Write me a message asking questions and then not respond for another week. Doesn’t seem to be well trained in therapy as well.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I cannot believe this. There is no support through customer service. I need a full refund. Telling someone to use another company’s app for therapy while you have a subscription to this app for counseling is ludicrous. Do not get this service for any type of serious mental health issues. This is not like going to a regular doctor or counselor at all. I’m so angry that I paid for medical services and i got the dollar store version of an actual counseling experience.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

It has been two months and I have not gotten a response from at least six different providers nor from the support team.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,The app is not affordable if you have a minimum wage job( majority of us probably do) the cheapest plan is over $200 a month. And you have to pay weekly even though majority of jobs give bi-weekly paychecks. I understand this is someone’s career and they are providing a service. At the same time the people have severe mental health issues and it’s really unfair that money is the way of us getting help. I would say install a payment plan or/and a free trial.

Great idea but a terrible platform and the app is not well organized.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,All of the reviews are 1 or 2 stars. It’s crap that these companies can scam people for there money and not pay people back or give them the services they paid for. The App Store should not allow this company to decide what reviews and stars can be shown. This is not cool. This is truly is ridiculous. If you need a therapist just call a mental health provider at your local clinic. Way cheaper and reliable.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

2. The sessions you get during the subscription are only available for the month you are subscribed to, they expire after. If your therapist is busy that becomes a problem.

When i reached out to support, they gave me a partial refund…. 🙄 and asked me to try a different therapist… — remember this costs $500+ a month just to TRY…. who wants to spend that kind of money to “try” a therapist?

1,"I signed up for a 1 month membership - having an acute situation to work through. I was matched with a therapist that appeared perfect. I set up a 10 minute consultation and we went through the “paperwork.” She was kind and professional. She suggested I book my first video session as her calendar was filling up quickly. The first available appointment was over a month out at an extremely inconvenient time. I contacted her and let her know I couldn’t wait a month. Additionally, the other therapists I matched with were not at all skilled in areas I needed. I sent an email to customer service requesting a cancellation of service. No where when I signed up was I informed that schedules would be so far out or so difficult to accommodate. I went through the cancellation and refund request steps and was refunded 2/3rds of the total amount paid, even though I used NONE of the service provided and cancelled w/in days of signing up. I have reached out to their customer support team at minimum of 5 times with no response. I even contacted the extremely nice (and obviously busy) therapist for assistance. She was told someone would contact me - still nothing! There is no phone number to contact this company! I have never experienced anything like this. How can a company that is supposed to assist with “mental challenging times” be the one that creates the most stress in your life? I am unable to move forward with my local therapist without my full deposit. His services are more expensive and that money is critical …. I would NEVER suggest that anyone use this service. Although it appears that there are some well qualified therapists, if you ever become in a situation where you require help from the company, it’s nowhere to be found!

1,"Not one to leave reviews but just want to warn people away from this app. TLDR - as far as my experience is concerned this is a scam, they rope you in with initial responsiveness and as soon as you pay you are stranded without support or appointment availability for months while you pay.

First interaction with the person assigning you to a therapist was great, immediate responses and good support explaining how the service works. As soon as I was assigned my first therapist though it went immediately downhill, they had no availability for appointments and when I asked over chat the therapist responded (rudely) saying they were overbooked and way over their allotted appointment number. They then probably realized I was a customer for help and not a bot/scheduler asking and changed their tone but they still could not take me and could not help me find a new therapist who did have time. I reached out to customer support to help me change therapist but I had no response (over one week to this date). I finally figured out that rating the therapist negatively would allow me to change provider and after doing that and trying my best to pick someone who according to the app had matching availability / experience I got stuck with someone who had just a 10 min slot 2 months away. So once again I am in a position where I cant change therapist so the money I paid for this month looks

I understand that therapists are busy and its hard to book appointments but you cant have a monthly paid service in which you recommend unavailable people to new subscribers and give them no way out or support. As far as I am concerned the approach of pulling you in with responsiveness to leave you stranded for months  while you pay is the definition of a scam, no matter how fancy your app is and how much celeb advertising you have.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

2,"I’ve had issues with every session except for my first. Here’s a running list:

* Have had to cancel/reschedule because the app isn’t working
* Lost half a session troubleshooting why they couldn’t see or hear me in the room and vice versa
* The app has blocked my counselor from booking sessions when we try to reschedule
* Sessions have disappeared from their calendar
* The app has allowed them to double book causing them to have to cancel
* Customer support is MIA and takes weeks to get back to you so don’t expect technical support

All this is when you finally get a counselor. Signing up for a counselor who is a good fit and has availability is a nightmare. 

Previously I was using better help and it just worked. You take a survey and you get matched with providers who specialize in the areas you want to work on. Easy. 

Talkspace shows you three people and in my case they did not have the expertise I specified. I decided to give it a chance and try someone. Well they had no availability for 3 weeks. And it was sparse after that. Not to mention their schedule was 7am-1pm, which did not fit my schedule. I went to switch counselors but the app requires you to rate counselors before switching. I reached out to Talkspace to see if they could help. A few days went by and I figured I was on my own so I rated them 4 stars to move on. Talkspace got back to me 3 weeks later. 

I ended up with a therapist I liked because the second time around I hit refresh to see providers until I could get a hint from the tiny bio that they might have expertise in areas I needed. The problem is that when you refresh those matches the previous ones are gone if you decide you’d like to go back to someone. It feels a bit like the app is removing choice in a way that is counter to therapy. The therapeutic relationship is super important it needs to be a good fit or you do more damage than help.

My therapist is great but we have had technical issues 90% of my sessions that result in canceling, rescheduling or losing lots of session time. This kind of makes therapy impossible. I’ve reached out to be credited for lost sessions but still haven’t heard back. Until they fix basic functionality I would stay away from this app. If you have the option I would go with better help.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"My experience with Talkspace was very frustrating for a few reasons. 
Although the therapist I was matched with was awesome, the frustrations with the app and how payment is structured lead me to quit and also lose about $400.
Note: I have been doing different forms of teletherapy for a few years now, including using BetterHelp. While not perfect, I still believe the pros outweigh the cons of teletherapy vs in person .
1. Talkspaces payment method gives you “credits” for therapy sessions . I paid $400/month for the privilege  of scheduling 4 therapy sessions in a month. If you don’t use them, you lose them in the next billing cycle .
2. You can’t just set up a weekly time to meet with your therapist. Instead, every month you need to schedule for that month. So, if you forget to schedule right away, you may miss a week or a few.
3. If your therapist does not have times available, then you are out of luck. This would not be a problem if you could just schedule a set time every week to meet with your therapist. This is how typical therapy as well as Better Help works . 
4. I had to reschedule a session prior to when the scheduled session took places. My therapist was fine with rescheduling , but without my knowledge I got charged an extra $65 dollars for the session . My therapist was not aware that this would happen either. 
5. Finally, For the month of March I had 3 sessions scheduled using the credits I had already paid for. However, because i chose to not renew my monthly subscription, with a renewal on March 10- the system shut me out on the last day of the billing period , even though I still had sessions scheduled that were prepaid for. So, I essentially paid $400 to just have one session . 
As someone with anxiety, this app made my anxiety worse . I would tell any therapists or clients  to avoid this app at all costs, it is not worth the confusion and frustration .",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I sent my first message to a therapist in early September. Waited 3 weeks. got no reply. Switched my therapist. Sent the same message to my new therapist end of September. Got no reply. I messaged talkspace to tell them I was disappointed. Deleted the app. In December  (over 4 months later!!) I got an email saying my therapist sent me a message. So I reinstalled the app. It was a generic message asking how I was doing but I was just glad to get a response. So I responded to the message. No reply for a few days. Then another message: ‘hi how are you doing?’ No response to the quite specific information I had given in my initial message or my response to the first one.. so I asked if this was a real person. ‘Yes my name is...*****’ then a few days later, ‘I hope you’re doing well’ so once again I responded with a specific response about how I was actually doing. Nothing. Days go by. So I tell the therapist ( and sent a message to talkspace support again)that I don’t see how this is supposed to be helping me or in any way construed as therapy and that maybe they don’t have time to take me on as a client.. Therapist then responds (very quickly this time) that they are so sorry but they are recovering from COVID. Wow. Why would you have people providing a service that for whatever reason they cannot provide? So am I supposed to feel bad because I expected actual therapy or Counseling from a counseling service??? What is the point of this????",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"It is literally impossible to choose a therapist that fits your schedule as you don’t know theirs until you pick them. Then you are locked into choice hoping person reaches out to you via text daily and video call weekly according to your insurance plan. If your therapist tells you to book next day, you can’t cancel less than 48 hrs without being charged for a no session (even if therapist cancels on you). If therapist chooses not to do video (so they can do other things while you are in a session like care for a baby) or decides to put you in speakerphone (a HIPPA violation of privacy), you’re out of luck (and sessions). Emailed “ticket” notes to TS is never answered until weeks later and they threaten to close the ticket if they don’t hear from you (no advance warning and no person our department to call). A waste of money and time as they use covid as an excuse to delay responding to your glitches joining a scheduled session due to technical difficulties. After over 1 month of trying to actually schedule a meet with someone, I gave up and TS charged my insurance for 1 session therapist canceled last minute and stated they couldn’t do on their end nor could they give me a session back. Another one had a speaker phone convo while tending to their baby and refused to go on video. Of course, month long billing already expired and. O sessions were achieved. Now they want to do an assessment on me- with what sessions to measure?",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I originally wanted to try talkspace because I have a tendency of running away after a few sessions. I thought the low commitment of talkspace might be helpful to me. Seems like low commitment is all you get from your therapists. I went through two different therapists that just wrote fortune cookie grade short responses that I’m sure they only wrote those so they wouldn’t get in trouble with talkspace as they’re required to respond to you in a certain time frame. I feel like that system is made with good intentions, but it seems seriously abused by the therapists. I absolutely would not recommend the therapists on this app. Your money is better spent on a REAL therapist. I’m sure the ones on here are better in person, but the system just makes it ripe for abuse.

The app itself is great to use and the user experience and onboarding process is great and welcoming, but that’s where the feeling of progress stops. The person who pairs you with a therapist doesn’t really care who you’re paired with. Therapists can put whatever they want on their profile and they won’t actually use their skills to help you. I literally received this advice by my therapist, “You have to develop some ways of calming yourself down.” I specially sought out a therapist that specialized in CBT. And asked what sort of techniques they might know. And I’m told to discover it myself. That’s what your $180 is paying for.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I loved the idea of Talkspace but I was a bit apprehensive as I was reading the reviews. Many people said they never heard back from their therapist and had to find a new one multiple times.  I eventually decided to download it but unfortunately, my experience was exactly the same. I haven’t heard from my therapist and it’s been well over a week since when I’ve initially contacted her the first time. I’ve done in person therapy and I thought I’d be a great candidate for TalkSpace. It’s ridiculous that you pay upfront for these services when a response back from a therapist isn’t even guaranteed. With the money I already paid for the month, I could have had 2 in-person one hour sessions (and I would pay AFTER these services were provided). I’m holding this platform to a higher standard because you all are offering therapy services to people who are requesting help. It’s really unfortunate that more often than not, people aren’t hearing back from their therapists. I’m not even going to try to find another therapist because I don’t want to waste another week of my time retaking the questionnaire/matching with a new therapist/ waiting for their response. It’s unfair to expect users to wait 2-3 weeks of their first month just waiting for a first response from anyone. Hopefully this platform will get better and I’d be open to trying it at that time.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"First and foremost I’d like to say that talk space was VERY easy to use, easy to navigate and the response time for getting connected with someone to match me with a therapist that fit my needs was quick and efficient. I have nothing bad to say about my limited experience with the app. That being said, let’s talk price. I’ve been in therapy since I was 10. After years of 280 dollar sessions with my therapist, my parents must have been financially exhausted. After insurance no longer covered some of the cost for me, I had to step away from therapy, my medication was no longer available, and my mental illnesses grew worse and worse. Talk space, though it may be a convenient and useful tool for those too busy to go to therapy or those who do not have an office readily available to them, is not a better alternative financially. It’s VERY expensive. Like 60 bucks a week expensive, or more if you choose a package not as limited. So please be aware of that, and if you can afford it then I suggest you give it a shot. I didn’t make it past choosing a plan so I can’t speak for the level of experience of the therapists or the interactions I may have had. This is just a review on price. I’d love to use this, but in this day and age the cost is simply too high.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I never ever write reviews and I certainly don’t like to trash people but I want to do this so that other people don’t waste their time and money on this. They coax you in with a very kind matching agent named Laura. She’s quick and caring and gets you to drop the money quick. Of course, if you’re struggling with mental health issues and needing help on a budget you’ll do what it takes. Then they match you with a therapist and tell you they’ll respond within 24 hours. The guy I chose never responded. So I went to search for a new therapist and was brought to a new matching agent named Holli Fiscus-Connon who took 20 minutes to respond and was so cold and uncaring. Short answers. No apology for my disappointment. Simply said “I found you a new match”. I clicked and what do you know...ITS THE SAME GUY THAT NEVER RESPONDED! I told her that it’s the same guy and that I felt disappointed and requested a refund. Without any remorse she just told me to message customer support. Cold, nonchalant, indifferent. Turns out she’s a therapist too! Who are these disconnected therapists that treat peoples problems so casually? It’s totally unacceptable. So disappointing that this is a business that is being run at the expense of people with mental health struggles. Seeing the reviews here, clearly this is something that happens a lot. App deleted.
Never again",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Before you offer an application that’s primary purpose is supporting mental health needs, PLEASE be responsible and ensure it works properly. My therapist on here is AMAZING. Love her! However using TS as a platform has been horrible. The app crashes, we constantly have audio issues even tho both of us do not experience the same issues on other platforms like Zoom and MS Teams. What broke the straw was needing to refill an Rx for an antidepressant. My therapist is saying TalkSpace won’t allow her to call in a refill without a checkin appt. the app is saying I need to pay $125/for a 30 min check in to get even though my insurance has verified more than once that it 100% covered. So here I am about to run out of my meds and there is no way to call anyone at TalkSpace, my therapist can’t call in my Rx, and so I’m stuck choosing to find a new doctor?! Or pay $125 out of pocket?! Wth. My insurance also told me they’d received several calls about this exact issue with TalkSpace. 
This is a SERIOUS issue folks. Messing with people’s ability to get access to their meds is not something you can chalk up to a “glitch” in your app. 
I contacted TalkSpace using the only method they provide - an email alias and promptly received an automated reply stating to expect a delay in response time. UNACCEPTABLE!!!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I decided to try Talkspace after being informed that my health insurance covers it. I felt that getting the account up and running through my insurance was more of a hassle than it needed to be (I told a co-worker that our insurance covers a Talkspace account and she said she got frustrated with the sign up process and threw in the towel) but I stuck it out. 

Once I was up and running, assigned a therapist, and completed some basic intake, I was free to utilize the app. I reached out to my therapist explaining in detail why I was seeking help. My first response actually asked me why I was there so I copied and pasted my original message again. Responses seemed to come once every 12-24 hours the first week but they seemed extremely short and pointless. After about 3 weeks with my therapist I had only received 11 messages and came to the conclusion that my therapist ghosted me so I requested a new therapist. As of today, he has been ignoring me for close to a business week. I reached out to customer service and asked them to cancel my account due to terrible service...I’ve been waiting a few days for them to cancel it...

I’m not even sure what to do with these guys anymore...they caused more issues than they alleviated and I still can’t get my account canceled.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I was referred to this app under the impression of “Talk to your therapist, anytime, anywhere.”, except the catch is that you CAN talk to them, but then WAIT possibly hours before the therapist actually responds. For $260, I was hoping I’d get immediate responses to anything I might need help with not I text my therapist and wait for when they can respond. Possibly hours or even the next day is when they would respond, by then I had already talked with someone else and I felt like I just wasted my money on someone who only has time for me twice a day. And for $260, I would expect to be able to video chat with my therapist but no. If your plan doesn’t have that feature, you must pay $65 for one video chat. And I believe that’s for the week. So just to use this app you’d need $260 but can’t forget the additional $100s on the side you would need to actually see your therapist. Not to mention that it’s hard to try to seek out other therapists because once you’re matched that’s it. You only have one therapist and have to base what you need on their time just to make sure you get a well timed response. If your someone who really needs this app or well therapy for reasons, and want someone who will respond in time and all the time, please find another app.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The Talkspace Customer Help section literally states: “Some clients like to set up a specific time each week so that they can message each other in real time”... but my Therapist literally said: “I am not able to set up a specific time to message back & forth”... lol sooooo which is it?? And don’t try to respond to this comment by telling me to contact customer service bc obviously I already tried that & in response to me asking if 2-3 responses/day was typical, they responded with: “Talkspace allows you to type out what you’re feeling at anytime. Unfortunately that does not mean the therapist is available 24/7. Like most professionals they are entitled to time off work.” 😆👏 I would never expect any professional to work 24/7... what a dismissive answer to genuine concern! They also said: “Usually your provider will respond once or twice a day. Our text based plan does not include a pre-set amount of therapy” SO in reality you’re paying $65/week for 5-10 responses/week... and the responses will probably be suggestions & advice you’ve e already heard before like breathing & meditation 😆👏 I originally switched to Talkspace from BetterHelp & honestly they’re both seriously terrible & way overpriced for how bad the advice is...",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"After signing up, it was all downhill: 1) they took my money and then a therapist didn’t schedule my first apt for 1 week, 2) when I reached out to customer service, they denied my request not to charge me for the time I was not getting service while waiting for my previously mentioned first appointment, 3) when I did try to reach out to customer service to ask them to wave the charges while I waited for my first appointment, they would barely read my emails and it would take them 2 days to respond. I cancelled my service and request a full refund. I would NEVER recommend this service. If you’re considering it, read the most recent reviews.

UPDATE: App developers reached out to apologize and gave me an email address to reply to so they could “make things right”. During all of my interactions with Talkspace, they had multiple opportunities to “make things right” and they just made my experience a drag. A customer should not have to send 3 emails to get her money back when an agreed-upon service is not being delivered. Shame on Talkspace for a half-hearted attempt at PR damage control. What would make this right? Improve your service for all the people on this forum who were paying customers.

1,"Seeking out therapy is a difficult step in itself. It starts by admitting to yourself you may need some help from a professional. I started talking to my therapist Sean on October 13. He was unable to attend any of the sessions I booked on his ""open"" calendar through the talkspace platform, and blamed his inability to sync his personal calendar with his talkspace calendar on glitches in the system. I finally had one 60 minute session with him where I confided some of my most personal issues. He barely spoke, and then 22 days after first talking to me, still hasn't been able to attend a second session, despite DOZENS of messages back and forth, and me ending up telling him I can work around HIS schedule. Just tell me ANY time that works for you and I’ll make it work. Today, November 4th, he just canceled on me yet again, same-day, just 4 hours before we were scheduled to speak. I guess he had an election party to attend. He could not care less about my issues. What a total waste of time and effort in a time when I needed therapy the most. Disgusting. This app is a good idea but nobody in need of help should ever have such a terrible experience, it does more harm than good to string people along like this.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up for talkspace and selected a therapist, then messaged said therapist about why I’m seeking therapy. Therapist responded within the hour to inform me they could not take me as a patient and I should contact customer support. I have no idea why I would be given the option to select a therapist who can’t take me on as a patient!? 

I reach out to customer support with only one response from their team about freezing my account. I replied immediately that I want a full refund and don’t wish to use talkspace considering I have no idea if any of their therapist can help me at this point. I’ve been reaching out for 3 days with no other responses from customer support so today I create a new ticket and for the first time I receive an automated  email about a refund wizard...so this A.I. refund wizard is allowing me a partial refund of $195 so Talkspace wants to charge me $65 for being turned away from a therapist and not receiving a valid response to my inquiry of reviving a full refund. Beyond mad right now, I’ll definitely be trying out BetterHelp because Talkspace has now added stress on top of stress because I don’t make that much money so $65 is actually a lot to pay for crickets and a locked door.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I have been very disappointed in this platform. Since October 9th, I have interacted with four different counselors- two of which were matched with me but who actually told me in the first message that they were actually not experienced/comfortable with working on my particular issues (which are not that uncommon of issues to seek help with). I am grateful for their honesty and directness, but I was disappointed that the Talkspace platform matched us in the first place. Unfortunately, each time I seek a new match, I am only presented with one to three options, and each time I have been offered the first counselor I matched with who
I couldn’t work with because they were so unresponsive and unavailable. This is very frustrating and at this point I am not getting much if any benefit here. I would attempt to get a refund if I could for the remaining time I signed up for, but it doesn’t look like getting a refund is possible at all. This has not been worth the large cost, especially to someone who didn’t have insurance or many financial resources to begin, with but needed to seek socially distanced help. In person therapy is always better!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I tried Talkspace after debating whether to sign up for MONTHS, and it was a disappointing experience. The quality of therapy is subpar which is really damaging bc if you’re anything like me, mental health is serious, and a bad experience sours my ability to seek help. If you have more serious symptoms and mental struggles, I don’t recommend trying Talk space.

My first therapist was ok, but our communication style wasn’t a good match. When I poured out my feelings and more serious side effects of my anxiety to him, he just honed in one innocuous detail (nail biting), and suggested an old wives way to stop. Like Yes, I appreciate the suggestion, but if easily Google-able methods of stopping nail biting would’ve worked for me, I would’ve stop 10 years ago. He failed to even acknowledge anything else I wrote.

My next therapist ghosted, she didn’t respond after 24-48 hours. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt before requesting that she respond, and when I did, she responded with a short reply that left no way for me to add to it. It was clear that she saw the notification to respond and just sent something to send something.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This platform charges a lot of money to do the bare minimum. I’m not sure if the therapists are being held accountable by the company for doing their job, but it doesn’t seem that way when one has to wait 15-20+ minutes to speak with a therapist for a SCHEDULED session that has been CONFIRMED, and this has happened even after switching therapists. It’s very disrespectful of people’s time and they need to acknowledge that access to therapy is not easy for everyone. Even taking a step to pursue therapy is a big deal, so they should make things easier by providing an efficient system for those who are able to utilize this service. 

Not only are there several problems switching between therapists and not getting a response from them, but Talkspace itself doesn’t even have a customer service phone number to reach out to. I don’t recommend spending any money on this service. I recommend that people use their health insurance to find therapists near them or search on Google. Find out if they do telehealth so you can get therapy remotely through them. That will be much more professional; this app is not as convenient as it claims to be and is taking advantage of vulnerable people.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"You cannot call and talk to talkspace! Let me say this again, YOU CANNOT ACTUALLY TALK TO TALKSPACE CUSTOMER SUPPORT!?!?!?!?!? They have no phone number. Your only option is to submit a “ticket” message to them. I have open tickets from July 26 they still have not responded to that were titled “this is time sensitive due to insurance changing”. Never. Heard. A. Word. Absolutely ridiculous. 
That being said, I love my therapist and the support she has provided me. But I would rather just see her privately and give her all the $ than use this terrible platform and let talkspace have any of the $ I am paying. Totally and absolutely mind boggling that I can’t get these people to write me back and am therefore waiting without being able to talk to my therapist because my insurance changed and there is no way to change your insurance information in the app without just starting an entirely new room. My therapist can’t take on any new patients so I’m not able to find her a match. I just want to change insurance and have the same therapist and be able to continue therapy for crying out loud. So stupid. So so so so so so stupid! Ugh! 😡",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I’ve been messaging the therapist I was assigned for several days with no response. I was told I’d have a response today by 10am, I didn’t. They changed my response time to 7pm. I tried changing therapists and haven’t been able to. I paid money for services I’m not receiving. And there is no number to call and emailing support says it could take up to 3 business days for a response. This is terrible for people who need mental health support.

Edit: I was finally supposed to talk to another intake person for a new therapist but by that point I found a therapist outside of this app who had time for me. I tried to cancel my subscription multiple times with no luck. Had to send another email to get my subscription canceled. They gave me a complimentary 30 minute video session....with who? My therapist completely ignored me and it took days to even be able to have the option to switch. They charged me $260 and I received absolutely no services from them whatsoever. In fact, it created more stress while I’m dealing with the loss of a loved one and needed a grief counselor.

1,"I signed up with talk space for a month a couple of years ago when I had a lot of tragic things happen to me within very short time frame, including my mother unexpectedly passing away. I was in a deep depression and couldn’t make myself leave the bed to do anything besides work and then I’d come straight home, so I thought this would be a great option for me. I was wrong and could have been dangerously wrong because I really needed help and I did not get that with talk space. The therapist I was matched with did not respond to me like she was supposed to per the package I paid for so I requested to be switched and they acknowledged my request but did not switch me. I tried to get what I needed out of it but all it felt like was trying to talk to someone who responds to you once every day or every other day so you aren’t really getting anywhere because it takes a whole month to even explain what’s going on. I should have been switched when requested, even the therapist admitted she was too busy to respond appropriately.  It was a waste of money I wish I would have spent elsewhere. I’ve wanted to try other services like this one and I’ve been too weary based on my experience with talk space.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"My first therapist was good and I started working with him right before covid and losing my job, so he was very helpful. But he constantly had video issues or I couldn’t schedule an appointment with him through the app. I stuck with him and was willing to tolerate the technical issues and assumed because he’s not as familiar with the technology. He constantly missed/ignored the response time requested and to me who has mild anxiety issue it is very uncomfortable. He then missed sessions for the third time and that was when I decided to switch therapist. I had all my chat history transferred to the new therapist and then she complained it was too much to read. She was also insensitive to my culture AND she missed sessions. 
I’ve been writing to customer support for all these issues and it takes weeks for them to get back. What do patients do when we can’t reach our therapists and customer support can’t help?
I ended up going back to traditional therapy though it is more expensive but I just need that consistency for emotional support and not letting my therapists become emotional drag when I have to worry if they are going to ghost me or not.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I’m 17, and do not live with my parents and am self employed. The state I live in (Texas) under certain circumstances a 17 year old is considered an adult and CAN receive care if they (in my case) have gone through physical or sexual abuse and have a stable income. The lady I talked to didn’t even look into it, and gave me an attitude despite me explaining to her and telling her. It doesn’t take more than two brain cells to research it. My therapist in PERSON was able to find the forms in under 10 minutes and is able to treat me. Nice to know this company cares about their patients, lol. 

I wonder how many people my age who need help get turned down or have possibly gotten hurt (whether it be self harm, or even parental abuse) because of the ignorance given by your employees. It’s not easy to leave you’re home in you’re in an unsafe situation and maybe the only way you can get help is online. 

If you’re a Texas resident and are 16-17 and do not wish to have your parents involved and have a job and stable income, you’re better off finding somewhere else to get help or going in person. Screw this company, lol.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I downloaded this out of pure need. My anxiety was out of control. I understand with the pandemic going on that therapy is in high demand. I had tried to find an in-person therapist, but to no avail. So I decided to give this a try. 
Downloaded it on a Friday, went through the whole intake process and got matched with a therapist...who wasn’t working until Monday. So i wrote to her about what my brain was doing, and tried my best to wait and hang in there, in the hopes that this would help. On Monday I received a message from her, stating that her caseload was too large and that I needed to choose a different therapist. Disappointing, but okay. 
I chose a different one, and then found out she wasn’t working on mondays but would respond by 4pm on Tuesday. She didn’t. So the app said I could nudge her and she would respond by 4pm Wednesday. I did, and she still sent nothing. 
It’s been seven days, I’ve received NO help. I cancelled my subscription and requested a refund, but I’m only getting three weeks worth of my money back. So essentially I paid for a week of no help.

Also by the time they would reply I’d be in another state of mind that the previous text didn’t even matter anymore, so what was the point??? I tried getting a refund, but they didn’t let me instead they only offered discounts for the next month and I of course wasn’t going to renew, so it was worthless. My last therapist was the most help and most responsive, but I still didn’t think it was worth continuing to pay hundreds of dollars. After more research I saw others had the same experience.

It took me quite a few tries to find one it would accept because it just kept saying it was “Too Weak” but again the only stated requirement is that it must be 8 characters. I used to work in finance and have had multiple trainings on creating secure passwords. I tried multiple combinations of upper and lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. I got so frustrated and tried a basic password that I used to use in high school and somehow that one was strong enough for them. I then tried to log in and it didn’t recognize the password. Tried to reset the password and went through the same process of trying to find one it accepted. It then told me several times the passwords I was entering didn’t match. I entered them several times very carefully making sure caps lock wasn’t accidentally on etc. Still saying it didn’t match. I give up.

2,"I love the idea of making counseling and psychiatric care more accessible, and was hoping this would be a great option in a pandemic world.

I tried to work with a talk therapist but after almost two weeks of messaging we hadn’t ever actually gotten to the point if starting to work on me.  She would ask a question, I would respond, and then a day or two later she’d ask another. 

I moved and had to change psychiatric providers because the original provider could write prescriptions in my new state.  They wanted me to pay for another initial evaluation even though the new provider, still through Talkspace, would have all the notes of my original talkspace provider.  I asked if this was necessary, and the “matching agent” said to ask my provider.  Let me get this straight… I have to pay a minimum of $199 for an “initial evaluation” for you to match me with a provider, and then ask them if what you already made me pay for is necessary? No thanks.  Going back to the traditional mental health care system.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"It is worth exploring other options. Loved the idea of Talkspace, but my first therapist ghosted me as soon as we matched and missed our intro meeting, and the Talkspace app canceled my second consultation with a new therapist (she had no idea what happened and there is no point of contact to reach out to for quick help with these issues). In a time when I felt incredibly vulnerable trying to open up to a therapist and really needed to talk to someone, the lack of help, communication, and transparency from the Talkspace team only added to my anxiety and stress. Great idea, poor execution for a service that is not worth the price. 

The concept is fantastic and I was able to receive a full refund, as I was never even able to have an introductory meeting with a therapist. I was also bothered by the little tests/check-ins/surveys for eating disorders - sometimes it is emotionally based because of stress and anxiety rather than a fixation on weight. I immediately felt misunderstood and that added to the overall stress as well.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I am really disappointed with TalkSpace. The advertising makes it seem like therapists will always be at hand to respond to you. It’s not like that at all. If you are struggling and needing to speak to a therapist right away, you won’t get that with TalkSpace. It could be hours later and you pretty much have to figure out how to navigate your problems on your own. And my therapist basically told me to figure out things on my own. It is a huge waste of money if you think your going to get great therapy at your fingertips. I even switched therapists to see if the chemistry would be different with another professional, but this professional responds less frequently than first. I’m literally pouring my heart and hear nothing. It’s a scam.

Update: I wanted to add that I have been on the app for a month already and am still in their “7 day” phase. We never agreed on goals or discussed treatment. I never received a progress report. I poured my heart out for a month a got very generic and short responses. I’ve made no progress and feel even more depressed and alone.

The response to my request was “No, sorry.” Yikes. I would never pay for something like psychiatry without being able to research the provider ahead of time. When I initially did the sign-up process, it defaulted to the therapy option, and I was at least able to see those providers, of which there was only one that met my needs. In theory, this should be a great service, but based on the policies and customer service, I’d rather do the work of researching providers that offer telehealth and scheduling with them directly.

Then September came and something catastrophic happened. Now I go days before I get even one message from my therapist. I can only guess it’s because he’s been inundated with new referrals that he cannot accommodate? And because of that, I now never know when I’ll hear from him next. Which is actually starting to contribute to my anxiety/depression. The app is now doing the opposite of what it’s designed to do. I think the issue is maybe you now have too many clients and not enough providers. Hiring more will help with this issue. If you want to help me further, I would like the terms of my subscription actually honored. I am entitled to 2 texts per day. I’m not paying you to get ditched like a bad date.

I picked a new therapist waited about 2 days and never received a response from them. I talked to the online counseling rep that helps you find a new one and got no response from them either. The next person I picked answered but never attempted to make any sort of connection, no introduction, no asking me what it is I felt I needed help with, nothing. She just chucked a sheet at me and said “here are some coping mechanisms”. So I chose another woman and it has been 4 days and still no response from them either. I sent an email to customer support and no response on that end. It’s like they made the app, had people sign up, and then completely abandoned it. I do NOT recommend this app to anyone.

1,"I had the app for about a week. The first 4 days were finding a therapist that would actually respond. Then, when I had one that responded, it was like they didn’t read anything I wrote. And then after actually responded twice in one day, they had to cancel the free video session. When I mentioned I wanted something more, meaning more responses, she responded almost immediately because she thought I wanted to schedule a paid video session. 

I canceled my subscription the next day when I hadn’t heard from my therapist. Then requested a refund on day 6 but they would only offer half back. So just a fyi, if u cancel within 48 hours & request a refund, they don’t really refund all of your money. I didn’t get any use out of this app at all in any way.

So, I matched with a different therapist and went through the onboarding process again. Well lo and behold the same thing happened! I went through the introduction process and left a message. No response. Opted to allow more time for a response. No response. Wow. I’m so glad I didn’t pay for this.

As for this app, I’m deleting it and I hope the makers can find more responsive therapists. It would be very unfortunate to let what seems to be a visually pleasing and nicely built interface to go to waste!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"If you are looking for therapy you can rely on on a consistent basis, this is not it. The interaction is sporadic. If you message your therapist, by the time they message you back it doesn’t even matter anymore. If you’re 4 minutes late to a session your therapist ghosts you. 

You spend up to $400 on therapy when you have very little interaction with your therapist. I had a few interactions that were good, thus the two stars, but for the price it isn’t worth it. Please save your money and look elsewhere. If you buy live sessions and you can’t schedule them because your therapist is busy they don’t roll over and you can lose the credits you pay for. It took almost a week for customer service to even get back to me. 

Maybe find a traditional therapist who has converted to virtual meetings or another app that actually cares about helping people and not just billing you every month like a Netflix subscription except WAY more expensive.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"At some point there was the ability to search the Talkspace provider directory without signing up. For mental health I have particular preferences I am looking for in a provider. It is really difficult to find providers that serve communities of color.  

This time around I could not search myself and had to pay upfront. My experience with the intake provider was poor. He called me by the wrong name. The intake form lacked the ability to specify more specific preferences.  After a day I was matched and unfortunately the 1 match was not a fit due to a preference I for got to mention. Another day goes by and the intake provider tells me that is the only match to my preferences when I told him the day before she was not a match. I wasted 2 days going back and forth for something I could have done on my own in 10-15 minutes. Now they will not give me a full refund. I feel ripped off. 

I strongly recommend against using this service. It wasted my time and money. For being a mental health app it stressed me out.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up for this because my relationship was in crisis only to learn my therapist was booked out a month. Can they measure time in arguments like couples do? “The doctor will see you in 26 arguments” would be disconcerting but at least it would honest. I don’t know if they’re are two different bots they use but the one that helps sign you up is fast and attentive, the bot that helps with refunds- not so much.  It’s like a Russian troll bot that is working for talkspace for extra holiday money.  Although I advocate for this bot to make all it can in a free market society, it can’t be at the expense of my time.  I would rather be stuck on an elevator with someone I barely remember from high school trying to convince me how “Jesus could change my life too.” 

I digress. The experience actually brought me and my girl together. So- in the interest of fairness- if you guys can prove that customer frustration is basis of your therapy & business model, I’ll leave a 5 star review in lieu of this one.

I have one remaining virtual session with my therapist but my plan has expired and trying to connect with customer service but no one replies at all. There is no phone number to call just an email, and no one checks these emails or responds so what is even the point. I am forced to take therapy offline, I cannot get any help with my subscription. Also the NYT article about their questionable business practices is a nail in the coffin especially considering my experiences.

My subscription has expired and to reactivate my subscription the app is forcing me to choose a new therapist. I would like to work with the same therapist I’ve been working with thus far and I’ve reached out to customer service to remedy this but there is no response.

1,"I tried two different therapists. The first was fairly responsive at first, but then I feel like she started being less receptive to what I was saying and became less responsive a few weeks in. After it was to the point of only getting one short message every few days and I almost felt like I was being ghosted, I tried switching. My new therapist STARTED OUT at giving one message every couple days, then devolved into only giving one per WEEK. I barely even got to give any sort of basic context about who I was because of how infrequently she responded and after two months with her I do not even feel the slightest connection or think she has any ability to help me. I am cancelling my subscription, coming out of it feeling horrible and like I will never be understood. I'm in disbelief that the ~$70 per week plan I was on seemed to be more like $70 per single message, all to make me feel worse and more convicted in my original beliefs than ever before at the end of all this.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

My therapist has ignored me and refuses to help since my insurance isn’t covered. (Even though I’ve paid full price). Anyway, enjoy, and DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP. 

:::::
Hi, I’ve reached out to your customer service about this before and I never get a response. I need to get this off my back before it happens to someone else. I paid full price for a month on this app and my “therapist” has been less than helpful. She said that my insurance doesn’t cover this and gave me a few referrals for in-person therapy in my area. But please correct me if I’m wrong, I paid full price, so I should get a full month of therapy whether my insurance covers it our not, correct? 

I tried this app TWICE now and have spent OVER $400. (I’m unemployed and have $0 coming in, so this was truly a splurge because I genuinely thought I could get ‘some’ type of counseling. But instead, I’ve been brushed off, leaving me feeling worse than I felt before I subscribed to this “service”. I wouldn’t feel this way if it didn’t happen twice. 

I sincerely hope you respond to your other paying customers more than you’ve responded to me (which was not at all). You did not uphold your reputation or high praises that I read online before subscribing myself. 

I will NOT be recommending your service. 

Thank you. For nothing.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I used Talkspace earlier this year and after what felt like decades I decided to give a different service another go and the difference was night and day. Talkspace was actually the first mental health service I’ve ever used and after one session I never wanted to seek help again. My provider seemed unprepared and uninterested in my first session. Barely asked questions and at the end of the session they told me “I don’t know what to tell you, I feel bad for you”. I am not exactly sure what the requirements are for working for Talkspace but based on my first engagement with my provider it seems that there is a lack of formal training/ screening in onboarding these therapists. The last thing ANY patient seeking mental health services wants to hear is “I don’t know what to tell you”. As with all things, I encourage everyone to shop around and see which therapists and platforms they vibe with the most. Make sure that it is someone that you feel comfortable with and it is someone that you can be unapologetically honest to.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I wish I read the reviews before signing up and spend over $1000 for three months. My experience after two months is: IF U HAVE A FRIEND, DO NOT USE THIS APP because ur friends actually care and can give better responses. The first therapist I had was not a good match. It was like chatting with a person that talks about the weather instead of addressing to my problems. The follow up from her was also poor. After pausing the therapy for 30 days I decided to give another try and this time only I thought I had an instant connection with my therapist but....I scheduled three video sessions with her twice she DIDNT SHOW UP!!! later on she said she had trouble logging in. The other time when we re-scheduled for a later time that same day she was late for 15mins.....I came here to get help for one small problem and now I feel more angry and frustrated. I would not change therapist again because I am not wasting my time and emotion again repeating my problems with a third one only putting my hopes up and then get smashed to the ground like a grape.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I was told by the matching agent via the chat function in the app that I would be able to select a therapist after paying for a subscription. She provided guarantees that I would be able to get a refund if none of the therapists were a match for me. We were messaging with decent response times (around 1-5 minutes to respond to my messages), but the moment that I actually paid the subscription fee and subsequently requested to be paired with a therapist, I was ghosted and did not receive any more responses that night. 

Also, the support function on the app is also weak to nonexistent. There’s no number that you can call, only a generic support ticket generator, which I also did not get a response back for. 

I am very disappointed with this onboarding experience. I felt that the purpose of the “consulting therapist” is one of a sales person whose sole purpose is to get you to pay up with no concern for actually delivering you a quality experience all the way through.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"As somebody who’s going through a lot, and has ups and downs. I texted a lot one day clicked the button for a response. He missed both of my deadlines then surprise a response 19 hours later. My therapist straight up told me “this is not a chat room, stop messaging me as often, I won’t answer until tomorrow.” I was under the impression that the app would give me help in a timely manner. I mean why should they give you a button for a deadline if their going to ignore it. Not to mention my first therapist on the app missed my deadline 4 times. So if you’re looking for an app to ignore you, and make false claims of being a chat room this is the perfect app for you. I’ve never written this bad of a review before but honestly if nothing changes I’m going to leave the app. If anything the app should have times were you can get instant responses, you shouldn’t have to wait 19 hours to get an angry response telling you this isn’t a chat room from the person who’s supposed to help you.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"For $260, the idea of having as much therapy as possible, especially remotely, was priceless.I think the work load must be pretty heavy because sometimes there is a full day or more that goes by before I get a response. I was sent the same paperwork twice and felt I didn’t matter enough. I wanted to talk to someone which was the whole idea I needed for therapy. I was excited for the chance but I am not communicated to enough to make it worth it. I think the therapists workload must be high because I did not seem important more often than not. I told the therapist about 4 weeks ago I was done. Cancelled the subscription and today get charged again $260. Very disappointing.  Stupid money sucking app. Very annoying and frustrated.  I want my money back. This is a little ridiculous.  I will try another therapy option. This is not it. I am a huge advocate for therapy too and I’m so disappointed.

1,"I gave this company and the app three chances to match me up and the process had been a nightmare. First they have you take these assessments only to off three people. Then when none of those do not match with what your looking for ie: education, years in field, specialties,etc, the give you a link that generates the same people. Over and over again. The one therapist that I did end up choosing, didn’t even have scheduled times for her patients. She used the app as kore or a diary entry that she would later respond too. Like a pen pall or playing phone tag. That is not healthy therapy. When you speak to customer service on the app they don’t seem to care about your concerns and even ask, “does your insurance even cover face to face therapy?” Ummm excuse me?? I wouldn’t even be on here or it wasn’t through my insurance portal. I found the process to be more damaging and now my anxiety is through the roof just trying to find some reliable help. I would not recommend this to anyone.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"If utilizing insurance and searching for providers the system doesn’t keep your insurance information, and doesn’t allow you more than 3 searches for a matching provider before you have to enter all of your information all over again.
The questionnaire for matching you is very generic, doesn’t ask any detailed questions, the most detailed it gets is a very incomplete drop down list of reasons for wanting therapy. No where does it ask you if you have spiritual preferences in your therapy. It also doesn’t assess in any way your previous therapy needs. 
Ultimately the app makes the therapy feel like McDonalds, and the therapist profiles don’t really tell you enough about the therapists and their approaches. I’m sure the therapists are qualified and very good, but the app is definitely not helping with their goal to help you. 
Suggest addressing issues with the search question on preference for therapist gender, currently returns top results with opposite of requests. 
Suggest addressing issues with insurance information- to allow you to store the insurance info so you can separately search for a provider instead of looping them together.

2,"Audio recordings is the most infuriating thing. 

I’ll be pouring my heart out or talking about some deeply personal in a way that isn’t easy for me, and then all of a sudden, I’ll look down and realize that either it’s come to the 5 minutes and the recording has ended, or the phone screen has gone to sleep and it ended the recording. So you have to hold your finger on the screen in order to get around that. I know that other apps utilize the api’s to prevent the phone screen from going to sleep when recording audio, so it’s absolutely on whoever the developer is for this app. 

On top of that, you cannot scrub the audio at all. So if, say it stopped recording randomly at 4:30, and you don’t know where it cut you off, and therefore where to start on the next recording you make, you have to listen to 4:30 of yourself droning on about problems with your mother to figure that out.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Recommendation for Talkspace: 0/10

I had my first ever therapy session at 2:30 today. I was anxious af about it. 2:20 rolls around and it says my session has started and to join... so I join 10 minutes early. Then it just sits there and says to wait for my therapist to join... so I sit there waiting for her to just pop up. 2:30 comes and I’m still just sitting there with my nerves shot. Another 10 minutes goes by and it says my session has expired and to reschedule... 30 minutes after that my therapist finally messaged and claims it wouldn’t let her join the room. She wasn’t even empathetic about it. Girl bye. I’ve messaged their customer service and let them know that I have received 0 therapy so I will be paying 0 dollars and to cancel my subscription. It took a lot to mentally prepare myself for that today. All for nothing. I’ll just use my insurance and go to a therapist in Nashville. It will probably be cheaper, and I won’t have to deal with all that.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I spent way too much time emailing Adrian in customer support and on the phone with my insurance. TalkSpace used 1 free session the first week without telling me, and again for my 5th session. It would say “congratulations! You just completed your 5th session” even though I only had 3 meetings with my therapist. TS is just after the money and doesn’t communicate with clients about the charge. I can’t even continue using TS because there’s no option to schedule my next session. Have been trying for weeks. Adrian in Customer support said he cannot open sessions for me to schedule. My therapist said she can’t either. And my insurance said I definitely have 5 free sessions even though I’ve only done 3. The services my therapist provided was just ok (then again I can’t tell if she really helps because I’ve only had 3 short sessions)
Wish I never signed up with TS.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"In conclusion, this doesn’t seem to be a company that values its therapists. But therapy is powerful and helpful, regardless of Talkspace’s business model. 

I’m grateful because I was connected to a wonderful psychologist who helped me a lot for 4 months.

BUT, from my observation, Talkspace seems very unfair to therapist.

I know that my insurance paid $71 per week (audio and texting therapy, twice per week ). My therapist made $22 of that (We had some billing issues and I became privy to this information). I mean, come on!!! At least pay them half.

Why? 
1) they deserve it
2) it encourages high therapist turn over. It’s really devastating to a patient to have your therapist leave. Especially, as you can imagine, the patients that come on this platform.

Regarding the app, it works pretty well:

1) I wish it had a feature that kept your phone from turning off while you’re talking.
2) I accidentally pressed a button once and started a session with a new therapist. To backtrack, I basically had to leave a bad review for that therapist. That feels bad.
3) Fix the billing issues and make it easier for your therapists to get paid

Therapists are your bread and butter! Pay them well! Why would I want to continue on a platform where the person who I learn to trust and lean on is not being valued?

Thanks for allowing my honest review.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"First let me say that my therapist was wonderful. Then, after a few weeks of building a relationship with her my credit card was charged a subscription renewal fee. This new fee was charged without any notification that it was happening and increased by nearly $100. This honestly just makes me so sad. I have experience going to therapy and taking on the task of finding a therapist so I will be okay. But a lot of people coming to Talkspace are getting therapy for the first time and many of them have chosen this format because they have anxiety around starting therapy in the first place. Those with anxiety and depression may find that starting over is too overwhelming and not seek help in the future. Giving people the chance to build a foundation with a therapist and then abruptly raising the price once it’s so much more difficult to walk away feels purposeful and predatory. These people are coming to you for help. Shame on you.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I cancelled this subscription after a month. I like that this app is available during covid time, when it might be difficult to get in to see a therapist in person. However, I do not think it could possibly be as helpful as seeing a therapist in person. I also feel it might be good for someone who has a quick issue they want to discuss, but it’s definitely not appropriate for long term therapy, in my opinion. I personally did not feel the therapist I was connected with was invested in what I needed, nor did I feel cared about by my therapist, and I feel this is exactly what so many people need. Especially at a time of such loneliness and isolation. For the amount of money a person must pay a month for services on the app, I expected a higher quality of care, and I worry about people who may think this is their only option for mental health care.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I don’t think I’ve written a single review for anything ever, but I am extremely disappointed in this app. 
Like everyone else stated below your therapist can get back to you at any interval, with the shortest possible response, and at any point in the day or night. I had a therapist text me at 1:45 IN THE MORNING to do breathing exercises?
I come from multiple different types of therapies. CBT, DBT, talk therapy, etc.
I personally matched with multiple therapist receiving almost the exact same response. 
“I understand, I’m sorry. Let’s do some breathing exercises.”
I am not discrediting breathing exercises or the practice of CBT. I find it can be very helpful. 
The problem though is that it needs to be paired with something that even sounds remotely like they read or listened to what you were saying. 
Talking about the death of a loved one or other large life events being met with an “I understand, I’m sorry.” To me personally seems so detached from the patient and their experience. 
I find this to be a way to shove a large amount of people seeking real help to one therapist who sends out a slightly edited text. 
There is no way these people have enough time or care enough to actually treat these people. While the consumer is paying a rate for a specialist they could see from a private practice.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Wow, this has been the worst “therapy” experience I have ever paid money for. Therapist wouldn’t respond, not just one but then two!!

I signed in and the subscription options showed up again? Confusingly, I clicked an option, assuming it would just take me back to my therapist... only to find that they had stored my Credit Card info and immediately charged my account a second time! 3 weeks later I’ve not had a therapy session with anyone, and now they are questioning why I want my $300 back that I didn’t want to charge to begin with!

I reached out, then didn’t hear back for 5 days and it shows she doesn’t have any online video appointments available at all. I figure my therapist is busy, so I request a new therapist. The matching specialist, Laura Premo, let me know there weren’t any other therapists so I should check back daily.

My first therapist was NOT helpful and she would send me poor quality images she found off of google instead of actually speaking with me and helping. She couldn’t hold a conversation whatsoever.

My second therapist when I tried the app again, was rude. She wouldn’t talk to me and she even made a scheduled appointment to speak with me, then never joined the chat and won’t reply to me. She hasn’t opened my messages or replied to me in over 4 days and has ignored/ditched our scheduled times. I paid a lot of money to be actively IGNORED and mistreated.

1,"Pretty useless if you ask me. When I was first thinking about signing up, I chatted with one the therapists and that seemed pretty helpful and what I was looking for. We went back and forth for about 30 minutes. We had an actual conversation. It seemed interesting and maybe I could save some money. Once I signed up, things were different... wish I had read some of these reviews first.

You essentially get two replies a day from your therapist, sometimes less. And honestly, I felt like I would get better responses talking on an online forum or something. It was essentially, “Am I understanding you correctly?” And “That sounds tough and like you’re going through a lot.” 

Gee, no kidding... thanks for that.

Not worth the money or the time. Not a substitute for in-person therapy, that’s for sure. Hard to cover any ground with two responses. You can’t even really have a conversation. I felt like I was basically talking to a wall or a bot. I’m opening myself up and not really getting anything back. It honestly felt more isolating than not doing it at all. And I’m not even struggling, just wanted to check it out and see if I could get some emotional support and guidance on a few issues since I found a therapy session or two in the past helpful.

Once matched I found that once I mentioned I was full time working mom in the midst of a pandemic all advice became centered around pedicures.  Self-care!  Get a pedicure!  That was the basic advice, not taking into account that I don’t even enjoy pedicures- however this procedure was sure to cure my feelings of being overwhelmed of being a full time teacher/cook/housekeeper/etc on top of my actual job.  My therapist suggested that instead of going back to school I should just take a spa day instead.  It was so patronizing, as though all women just need to spend time pampering to feel complete. No need to suggest that I reach out to feedback/customer care- I have and received a reply that that will try to do better for others in the future.

I asked if the matches had the certification I was requesting - no answer. I chose a therapist, again not certified in what I need. I spoke with a third matching agent, was again explicit with my needs.

I signed up on Saturday and was matched quickly by that afternoon but my therapist never ever responded to me after I wrote my heart out. By Monday night I decided to switch therapist and then realized I had to write it all out again to this new person. I was definitely not up for that task as it had been taxing to do it the first time. 

I contacted support TWICE to get a refund and had to wait for them to get back. Just to find they send out an automatic email to a refund wizard to ask for my refund. I’m furious!  This could have been easily done through a fast response or had an option to do it when I was submitting the request. No word yet on that refund. 

If you are thinking about this go do some research on the internet of therapists who have signed up and the training they get. They are told to be vague in their responses and drag it out as long as possible. I’m glad my person never responded since likely I would have gotten strung along with no help at all!

I paused my membership so I wouldn’t get billed but then when I asked to cancel their support team said I had to do it myself through the app which isn’t possible while it’s frozen. So what does this bs company do? They unpaused my membership and charged me nearly $300 for another month I clearly wasn’t going to use, then told me I was free to cancel. What total bs! I emailed the customer support a second time expecting a refund since I haven’t logged onto the service in over two months except to pause my membership and seek a cancellation and what do you know... absolute radio silence. They also pay their therapists an insanely low amount compared to what the customer is charged. IE if you pay $60 for a video session, your therapist get $30 and the app keeps the rest.

I attempted to contact customer service to refund that money, as I haven’t used their services.

1,"Talk Space, you’re wasting your advertising budget. Seriously. I came here after a tv ad and immediately filtered the reviews by *most recent*. Nope. Not happenin. I don’t know if you think us consumers are dumb, as though we don’t read reviews before we download, but I especially do if it’s a paid service. I’m one less person who will be filling your piggy bank 🏦 The reviews can make or break a consumers decision to engage with a company. There are far tooo many negative reviews mentioning that they paid but the advertised services were never rendered. I don’t have time to play games like that. DO BETTER. Or …let it get so bad that everywhere your audience goes for reviews is littered with NEGATIVE reviews and you really tarnish the brand name. I’ll check back maybe in a hear or two. Smh. Seriously, identify what people are complaining about and DO BETTER.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I was referred to this app by my sister who had a very good therapist for her postpartum. I decided to get some life and relationship advice. After her great experience and great reviews I decided to give it a try. They promise your therapist will be in touch a few times a day. But that wasn’t the case. I picked a nice therapist and it took a week to get a generic welcome message. After replying with my concerns she never replied. So I waited a week and still nothing. I thought maybe she just was too busy for me so I switched over to a new therapist. After 3 weeks and 2 therapists later I didn’t even get a reply or help. I decided to cancel my subscription but since I used the app for 3 weeks I didn’t get my full money back. I was pro rated for using the app. What a horrible terrible customer service and even more of a garbage app. Stay away.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"Around 2 years ago I was a mess and really down. I had gotten a 3 month voucher for talk space and my therapist was really able to help me. Sadly my voucher was up and luckily I started feeling a lot better and kinda was able to go out without it. Flash forward to now and I run into struggles again with being a first responder and healthcare worker during the covid pandemic and now I can’t get help. The prices a week are just ridiculous. They claim to give free services to healthcare workers and have gotten so many donations but i’ve yet to figure it out because they make it so difficult. This app would be really great, especially now when the world is in a tough spot but talk space is way too money hungry. Overall it’s a great program, just way too much money and in the end it’s not worth it.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app is advertised as if you can talk to someone 24/7, however, the therapist does not respond 24/7. In my opinion, it’s better to talk to someone in-person so you can actually resolve your issues in a timely manner. I signed up for this app because I’m a full-time working single parent with a child with special needs. It’s hard to steal away an hour to get anything done for myself. After customer services collects your money, it’s hard to get in-touch with them. I reached out to them almost 2 weeks ago after my therapist had a sudden lost of a family member, but they have not did anything to help me or the therapist transition out of her care while she grieved. Long story short: Save yourself money and vent to a friend via text. You may not get the same clinical advice, but you won’t feel duped if you’re without a therapist and your money.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I haven’t had much success off this app to be honest. I’ve worked with 3 different therapist so far. I wish the app provided users with a list of therapists to pick from.  The app matches users with 3 therapists at a time based off really generic information the user is able to provide. I feel like none of the suggestions offered to me have been good options to assist me through the struggles I’m having. I get the sense that many of the therapist are overworked on this app so, in my experience, i feel more like a number, or a cog in the machine, which is the last thing a person wants to feel like when they are already depressed. But this is life now during pandemic times. Sigh. Def don’t recommend this app to people with moderate to severe anxiety / depression.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"If you plan to use this, don’t plan on getting any real help. With the time that it takes to input or record your information and get it to your therapist, you wind up feeling very disconnected and unheard with no real support.

This is a very difficult time with the virus, but having to type in your information or wait to hear back from her therapist is not the way to support depression and work through issues. 

And now I am trying to get my money back for unused time and a virtual session that I was unable to get due to my therapist having a busy schedule, and things are becoming a nightmare. I have done nothing but wasted over $250, and with being unemployed and wanting to get help to pull me through dark times but getting nothing in return,  this is Not remotely worth the money!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Honesty wasted my $200 bucks on this platform. I reached out to get help for my issues because i don’t have access to traditional counseling and all i got was counselors that just didn’t reply. Like others have mentioned what is the point of this whole program, app, whatever if therapist don’t respond to you like you are having a regular conversation and they don’t reach out to you to show they care and want to ACTUALLY help you. It’s not a talk space if it’s literally filled with silence. I’m not even mad about the money i’m more mad about the fact that for lots of people like myself included, though that that this app would genuinely help and if anything it made me feel more frustrated and anxious and just overall let down. I’m telling you right now, don’t waste your time or money on this app",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"Started off well, and I recommended it to everyone I could. Then my therapist became less and less available, or would send non-responses to my concerns (“oof nice flex” was an actual reply my therapist sent me).

After five months, I switched to the monthly plan, which gave me weekly (instead of daily) access to my therapist. That started off well but then she fell off the face of the planet. No check-ins or anything for a month. I switched therapists, and still haven’t heard from him now a week later. 

I understand that everyone is going though something and that we’re all anxious and stressed to the max, and I am hopeful that there are TS users who are getting adequate care. This just ultimately wound up quite disappointing, so I’m on the prowl for another app.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,This attempt at using TalkSpace was a total waste of my time. Canned email CS responses takes days. No phone number to call. They unilaterally assigned my therapist even though I asked for more time to review my choices. And that therapist cancelled on my appointments. By then a whole month passes and I was out of subscription fee without receiving any services! 316 dollars later I received zero visits. No way to get my refund. This added to more frustration rather than getting any support. It is a lot easier to find your own therapists in your area by looking up Psychology Today’s list of therapists by specialty. Most of them offer video/calls and will provide you with receipts for FSA reimbursement. Don’t buy into the commercials on TV. This is just a third party app company out to get money from people who needs help.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This review has nothing to do with the therapy provided but is about the functioning of the app. The support is abysmal. I set up an account 5 days ago and encountered numerous issues. I have not been able to cancel my subscription—the provided FAQs lead me to a webpage without the option of canceling the service. I have now been charged TWICE, and I still haven’t heard back from the customer support. I am very dissatisfied with this service.

Update on Sept 7 - thank you for replying to my review. However your time would be better spent replying to my actual concerns. I have submitted NUMEROUS support requests in the last 14 days. I am unable to cancel my account (your FAQs are incorrect) and I have been charged twice, received zero therapy, and received absolutely NO response from Support. This is shameful.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"In my experience, the doctors have been good but the platform is bad. It is organized in a very bizarre way that is not user-friendly. Also, when you need help with something, it takes a long time because you have use their submission method. The matching agents can’t help. Also, to schedule an appointment you basically have to get permission to be allowed a certain amount of appointment time. For example, I need a 1 hour appt but it’s only allowing a 30 minute so the doctor won’t accept it. Which is an asinine way of organizing a platform specifically for people struggling with mental health. 
Overall, the doctors I’ve had are good but, if my insurance covered a different app, I’d leave in a second based entirely on the platform.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Good luck getting support from anyone at TalkSpace. I made an error on some of the initial forms and also have a billing issue. The only way to contact TalkSpace support is email and 14 days later I still don’t have a response. They still managed to bill me for service though!

About the platform experience: My matched therapist spent the first two days describing her policies for when she checks and responds. She had a limit on word count per week (so not really “unlimited” messaging), then promptly announced that she was leaving on 10 day PTO. Billed me for a $120 session at that point. No thank you. Switched to a new therapist who has been better.

Approach this one with a huge measure of caution. Very unreliable considering the cost associated and the seriousness of health issues they are supposed to be treating.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"After reading such positive reviews, I really thought this would work for me but I’m guessing that it’s really if you get “lucky” with the provider you pick. You get to chose from 5 options - however if you “pass” on those to see other profiles, you can’t go back. So you can’t compare more than 5 at a time which is just bad programming IMO.   During my month of trying to find someone that “fit”,  I tried 3 different therapists and had TWO providers that didn’t respond!  I even worked with the Customer Service agent who recommended one of the ones who didn’t respond.   So - if you’re feeling lucky and have $200 + to gamble with, I guess take a chance but I feel like my money and time were wasted and I’m really discouraged about finding someone that can help me.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I was really excited to try online therapy since COVID makes it difficult to see people in person. I was able to sign up with my insurance and matched with one therapist. 

I wrote a nice little intro for her and received no response by the time limit Talkspace gave me. No worries, I chose to wait longer. After not receiving a response a few days later, I was given the option to change providers. I chose this in hopes of getting someone with more availability. 

I was matched to a matching agent who almost immediately told me that she didn’t have a match for me, and to contact support to be added to a manual matching list. I did this because was willing to wait until someone was available. 

Support got back to me a few days later, only to give me a blurb about how I can chose the “Change My Provider” option on the app, which was no longer available. Wrote back and told them that my “matching agent” told me to ask to be added to a manual matching list. No response a week later to even acknowledge my question. 

I guess this isn’t for me, but I’m disappointed that I was so easily brushed aside by an app that’s designed to help people.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I was disappointed in the lack of flexibility in this platform and quit soon after and won’t be back. I’ll see an in-person therapist that bills my insurance but still will let me have video sessions. 

The service only allows you to have video call infrequently (~once a month). Most therapy must happen over text, which in my opinion is not supportive and only useful when you have an already established relationship with a therapist. 

I was also unable to cancel whenever I wanted, instead I was only able to cancel at the next billing cycle. Additionally, you can pause your therapy (and payment) but only for a week at a time and you couldn’t set dates.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The idea of the app sounded great so I was excited to sign up. 

They let you chose from a range of therapists, you send the therapist you chose a message and they are supposed to get back to you in 24 hours. After a week, my chosen therapist never got back to me so I had to start the process over again. For a service that costs $316/month, that was already $79 wasted, but I decided to give it another try. 

I chose a new therapist and was ready to start treatment, but after a few messages, my new therapist said she was leaving the platform in a few weeks and I would have to start the process over again.

Now, three weeks into the process, I still have not been matched with a therapist, but I did lose $316 for nothing. 

Of course, I canceled my subscription, so in November, I was surprised to see a $316 charge on my account. 

TalkSpace support takes 21 days to get back to you if you have any issues so it’s clear that this issue with not be resolved soon. 

Overall, I had a horrible experience with the platform and for people who are already suffering from anxiety and depression, do not put yourself through this.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I needed a therapist. Covid blues. I matched with a few people and selected one. I got very little feedback. I needed more, so I changed providers. Much of the same. They didn’t take time to get to know me, and I felt more like I was journaling more than working with a therapist. I even paid for a video chat to try and help. I tried a third provider, as I paid for 6 months and I wanted to give this a fair go. They were by far the best, but ultimately I still felt more like I was journaling via text with someone who gave generic feedback and didn’t ask questions to get to know me. 

I now see a therapist in my city. We can do virtual and now in person. It is remarkably better. I won’t ever use a service like this again.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Your therapists are great. However it took me 3 months to find out my insurance payer id is the same for three different dropdowns on your insurance selection. If you do not select one of the main four Talkspace does accept they will over look this and assume you are not insured. (I can explain this easier in a phonecall as I am not revealing my PHI in an app review. )I called my insurance three times and they always 100% say I should be insured. This error needs to be fixed if it isnt already. Also the whole ""check coverage"" process results in an error message in the end. Ive had three different support tickets opened for this. Why cant I just get someone on the phone? email is way less productive for these kinds of issues.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app is a complete joke.... DO NOT use this app if you are seeking help for mental illness. I was seeking care for anxiety disorder only to pay my “co-pay” and find that my provider is on “time off” for 3 WEEKS! After the 3 weeks had passed, she’s then on time off for additional weeks... I finally gave up and asked for a refund, no reply. Figured I’d give it one more shot... nope, provider is now no longer offering service. 🙄 AGAIN, contacted about a refund, no response. Few weeks later, figure I’ll give it one more go and find a new provider. Nope. “No provider that match your needs”. I have reached out a 3rd time now for a refund. Nothing like adding stress to someone who is already trying their best to manage stress! I would no under any circumstances recommend this app to others.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I would love to give this app a higher rating because I love being able to send messages to a therapist, and have the therapist respond with meaningful messages, and I felt it was worth the money. I have nothing bad to say about the actual therapist. 

The reason I am rating it so low is: the app updated, and it signed me out of my account, and I cannot get signed back in. I contacted the customer support, and after a while they just stopped messaging me back. For that, I think this is a waste of money, and I am very upset. I don't know how to even cancel the payments since I can't log back in, and the support team is ignoring me. I guess it wasn't worth the money after all since support doesn't give a crap about the needs of those trying to get help.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app is awful. Luckily I am not someone who has a severe mental disability/needs immediate assistance because if so, this could end poorly.

I signed up for TalkSpace and the first person I matched with blatantly ignored me. I reached out to her time and time again and she said she was busy. So frustrated, I decided to match with another therapist who said she may respond up to three times a day. Great, I thought. But no- this new therapist has ignored me too. No response after pouring out my emotions. I need help. It’s so frustrating that this platform hires people who are so unprofessional that they don’t have the decency to say they can’t help you due to time constraints or whatever it is. It makes people who already feel alone feel sad and isolated. Do better, Talkspace.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"That word is simply enough to describe Talkspace. Upon signing up you are directed to choose a therapist from a list that a “matching agent” will present to best suit your needs, and to choose carefully. I was given ONE choice. I felt instantly horrible about myself that I was just so broken only one therapist could help. I spoke my feelings to the “matching agent” and I was given more options. I selected a therapist to NEVER get a response, over multiple days. I was then allowed by Talkspace to choose another Therapist for lack of communication efforts. After choosing my SECOND therapist I have barely gotten any communication, maybe 4 text responses, and I mean the communication I have received is irrelevant to my Therapy at all. This app will cripple mental health patients really seeking help. Do not join Talkspace.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The nurse practitioner I found was very good and that is why I gave it one  star. Unfortunately, the customer service is horrific! I had to send three request to help me with my vouchers. My insurance company gave me unlimited vouchers to use for Talkspace. Every time I try to book another session I was being charged the full amount. I had to write three times to customer service and after four days got a response. Customer customer representative did not answer my question at all. When I said I’m going to cancel and just not use talk space anymore the customer rep said sorry to see if we leave bye. I could see this up feeling completely. People who go to Talkspace need help emotionally and to have to deal with this calluses and stupidity is so sad.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"It’s Covid, times are stressful — thought I’d try online therapy instead of finding someone locally. What happened next was truly horrific. The therapist asked some questions about what brought me to Talkspace and after I’d answered — sharing some deeply personal information — she ignored what I’d told her and started sending PDF forms of different evaluations for me to fill out. Some of the questions were very triggering and when I told her that, she got defensive and tried to put it back on me that I hadn’t “warned” her of any past traumas. Huh?? Isn’t that what the therapy is for? She got even more combative and I had to ask Talkspace to stop her from messaging me. Hopefully there are better therapists on the platform but my experience was AWFUL.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"My husband and I tried to get couples counseling from this app. Our therapist canceled the first session, and he never showed up to the second session. Talkspace basically has no customer service at all. A couple weeks after I submitted a “ticket” to request a refund, we received an automated message from Talkspace. This was not individualized in any way. It pretty much said, “hi, we see you had an issue. Please let us know if you still have an issue.” I am beyond fed up. We paid $316 for 4 sessions. Still no refund. This company is disgustingly unprofessional. Anyone trying to get help for mental health issues, try another app. Please.

1,"It’s been three weeks and filed two tickets unresponded to, to be able to book a video therapy session which I had paid for but the app would not allow me to book. Still no response and since my therapist still sends me messages after I said I wanted to stick to video, which I do not respond to or engage in therapy in any way through text, I need to pay if I want to book a video session since that text quota has been meant on their end, which again I said on my initial call I wanted to only do video and not text. On top of that I paid for a 45 minute session that I didn’t get and must now pay for only 30 minute sessions, was told on the initial call they would be 45 minute sessions.

Say you sign up on the first of the month for the most expensive package which includes 4 video sessions. Any thinking person would think that the video sessions are one a week. However, after you pay you are assigned a counselor. If that counselor has no video availability for three weeks you have to do all 4 sessions in 1 week’s time! For my first video session, my counselor cancelled. He had no availability that week or the week after. He said I should get a new therapist! People who sign up for this service are obviously in a fragile state. To be hoodwinked and rejected all at once is the definition of an evil company.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I had talkspace for almost a month switching providers 4 times due to lack of engagement, communication, and acknowledgment. The therapy process is not effective and talkspace should create a base set of expectations for their providers. God forbid someone was in a crisis and needed a quick response they would have to wait 5-7 days before they may or may not hear back from their therapist. After introducing myself and explaining to my 1st therapist why I was coming to therapy she instructed me she had to send me additional paperwork and to NOT  respond to her message due to her feeling ill even though she was scheduled to work that day. Therapist #2/3 initiated the conversation but after following up they didn’t respond after a week. Therapist 4 just never responded.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Talkspace will happily take your money without providing therapy or customer service. I signed up and a therapist never reached out to me to even welcome me to the app. Days went by with no responses. Customer service ONLY has an email address to contact them. They just send a form response back and then leave you in waiting indefinitely. They use shaming language in the response to make you feel like a jerk for even contacting them. I had to end up getting my credit card company to step in and issue a refund bc the customer service still hasn’t replied to my concerns. I would stay far away from this app and service. I’m trying Better Help next and hopefully that will be a much better experience. Therapy shouldn’t be frustrating!!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"No one messages you. The sign up lady didn’t write me back for a week! So I messaged her seeing if she got my messages.  No acknowledgement or anything on why she didn’t write me back. Just going on about like she didn’t write me for a week.

Then I was paired with a therapist. It said “expect a response by 9pm.” I waited all day and no response. Next day comes... so I write “hi there just messaging to see if you got my messages.” No response. 

Contacted customer service. Waited a day no response from therapist or customer services. Next day no response again from either. So now I’m trying to get my money back. It’s going on day 5 no response from anyone and I’m out 260 dollars and no one to talk to because TalkSpace seems like a ghost town and no one writes you back.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

But this was not the place to try and find peace. Between one word answers and another provider never replying to me for over a week, I just feel cheated. I figured I would feel just a slight bit better but instead I just feel even more frustrated. It’s sad that I tried to get help and just lost money and a little hope that I’ll be able to feel better. I hope other people haven’t had an experience like mine, but the fact that it happens at all is just rough.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The therapists are not responsive enough and you actually AREN’T allowed to schedule video chats because therapists aren’t mandated to share schedules.

I ended up bailing because I can’t see myself doing this every single time I want access to my therapist, when we could have theoretically simply set up a regular meet time? BTW I’ve been begging them for a refund for weeks and they ignore me and my phone calls. It’s dishonest since I never received any therapy, I only received logistical messages for 400$.

Besides the non existent app help, I didn’t really like the feeling of trying to explain and text out my feelings through an app & then wait a few hours for a response. Personally, I feel like I need to talk to someone face to face . The video chats didn’t work at all for me and constantly froze & skipped and it was impossible to gave a conversation.

1,"It took me less than a week to realize this was not working and is pretty close to a scam. Full disclosure, I only worked w one therapist, and did not care to find another. 

When I started talking to my therapist, I tried to be really detailed and use specific examples, to make things easier with text, but the first couple responses from her were really generic like, “and why do you think that is?” Or “and how does that make you feel?” Or “that’s not good.” It was like a BOT was responding. Like, they never even referenced what I had been talking about in the previous text. For all I know they didn’t even read what I wrote. It’s hard to type all of your thoughts out as it is, but then to get a weak response back? It’s like a slap in the face. 

Then I looked into it a little online, and saw a comment from a therapist that said the TS therapists are paid little and stretched too thin. No wonder they are writing generic, short answers. 

This is all without mentioning the insanely high prices for not even getting a face to face experience.

1,"I’ve been using it for a month and feel no improvement. Touting this as a therapy app when it’s $65/week for a single response per day 5 days per week is....probably a bit unethical at best. For what people need in times like these, this is a waste of money and a waste of time. If you want any sort or progress, this is not the app for you. Book an appointment with a real therapist who offers telehealth. This process is way too slow for mental health.

People come here with real problems. It’s not fair to leave them on read. I did not shell out hundreds of dollars to feel like this. I shelled out hundreds of dollars seeking help to stop feeling like this. I gave them the benefit of the doubt twice, but it is unacceptable for this to happen with three different therapists in a row.

The therapists I encountered don’t understand how to use the live session platform so it makes it difficult to book a live session. The responses you get from texts equate to how does that make you feel with very little insight.

I was in a strained relationship, made worse by the start of COVID quarantine. He heavily pressured me to break up with my partner and in retrospect I feel like that decision wasn’t fully mine.

My second therapist after a week said that she would be taking a different job and could no longer be my therapist. On this app the therapists can also change their available video hours, or cancel appointments without notice.

Why offer promo codes if you aren’t going to have a spot to put it in..... the fact I can’t put those in, I can’t schedule with my therapist cuz she’s too busy... got this for my birthday now I’m questioning.... charging me in full when I had $100 off I’m paycheck to paycheck and can not afford that extra.

1,"Incredibly disappointing. First, I was matched with a therapist who couldn’t take on another case. Wasted a few days of my subscription waiting to be matched with another therapist. This one seemed to only want to do live sessions, which would be fine but I also signed up because i wanted to use the texting feature for daily communication/assistance/therapy but was met with “we’ll talk about it at our next session.” By the time I decided we were not a good match, I didn’t feel it was worth opening up to a new provider and hoping things would be better before renewing my subscription and being disappointed again. It was a big step to admit I needed help and to seek therapy, so i’m feeling very discouraged.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"It’s safe to say that it’s better to go pay and see a local therapist than use this app. I like it’s premise where you can talk to someone when it’s convenient for you. However, like texting a friend, they reply hours later and the conversation isn’t the same. I had two different therapists in 3 weeks time and it felt like I was talking to a brick wall with both of them. I think it’s much healthier to just go create a relationship with a therapist in person who will see you as a client. I also feel like my friends or a self-help book could’ve helped the same as my therapists did. I did not find talking to them very helpful. This app felt like a waste of my time and money but you know it is what it is, I took the chances.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app is terrible and an absolute waste of money. I feel like I’ve been tricked or something. I got matched with a provider who completely ignored me, so I switched to a new provider on a Friday. She is off Saturday and Sunday, so fine I will wait till Monday to talk to her. Nope, I get a message saying she is off for two weeks. I am essentially paying $300 for less than two weeks of service. Also, why match me with someone who is taking vacation immediately? I understand providers are probably overwhelmed and busy, but the least they could do is match me with someone who isn’t going on vacation immediately or someone who is a bit more responsive. I am requesting a refund and am going to find a legit therapist in my city.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I reached out to T/S (affiliated with my health plan). You start off by taking a quiz, and at the end of the quiz they give you three therapist options, making you think that they used the quiz to match you up. However, I think it’s just spin the therapist wheel and see who comes out b/c I clearly said I preferred a female therapist and lo and behold one of my options was a man. 

So I chose one of the women whose brief bio seemed to match my needs. They prompted me to set up a 10-min Zoom-like appointment. I also shared some details via the online portal. A day later, the therapist wrote back to say she wasn’t taking new clients. See how random that therapist wheel really is??

I reached out to T/S support. More than 2 weeks later I hadn’t received any response! I reached out again (even though they warn against sending a second reply because it will DELAY a response). Still nothing. 

T/S plays with your emotions. When you reach out for therapy, you need help, you need caring, you need support. I got none of the above.

Do not cede your mental health to a tech company!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"My second counselor, Victoria, was absolutely wonderful! The problem is with the app and the way in which matters are handled. My first counselor never replied after three days so I had to switch to a different one. I was going to ask for a refund, but I was offered a free 30 minute session as compensation for my poor experience. Trouble is, I was never able to use my free 30 minute session because nobody could figure out how to apply it to my account or nobody cared. I’m not sure which is correct. Anyway. I find it’s very difficult to get in touch with people who can provide customer service to help you.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"When this started, I thought my therapist was nice, but as the month went by I realized that she really did the bare minimum and did not offer any suggestions to help me. It’s also been 8 days since she checked on me, even though they charged me for more service. Now for the important part - I’ve been trying to contact customer service for 7 days now and they will not respond to any of my messages. They also charged me the full amount and did not file it with my insurance as they lead you to believe when you sign up. Last, they charged me even when I wanted to cancel. Terrible, terrible program. I should have known better and used a real practice that offers telemedicine.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I decided to try app therapy because I don't have to set up an appointment and wait until then to express my thoughts. However, after a week of using this app, I'm very disappointed. The therapist was not responsive. Even when I used the ""send notification to the therapist"" button, she simply replied and told me she was ""on a break"", while it showed ""working today"" on her status. As days went by, I felt like I threw my money down the drain. I contacted customer support, they only had email communication and I got an automatic reply. When they say ""cancel anytime"", it really means cancel anytime but we won't refund your money. 

This app added more anxiety to my already need-to-seek-therapy life.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"1) I failed to find an orientation video to help navigate the features of the app. I had to experiment and ask questions to the therapist about technical aspects. 

2) A prerecorded video introduction from a potential therapist would be ideal for selecting the right one. There were short bios about a paragraph long. In hindsight, it turned out not being enough information.

3) Advice for first timers; do research on the therapy methods offered before selecting a therapist. I went in blind and CBT wasn’t for me. They offered a different method, but it turns out in my case I just needed someone to listen to me. I worked out a lot myself, on my own. Verbal and written communication can be cathartic by itself. 

4) Canceling the subscription has you answering quite a few questions and feels like jumping through hoops. Includes offers for different therapists, subscription level changes, and “just in case” back up plans. This could be interpreted as concern, but we do live in a capitalist society. ;)",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I started Talkspace in January and in general it’s been a great experience! I love my therapist and I have no complaints on that end. However, since wanting to add my insurance to my existing account to hopefully move back to daily therapy sessions I’ve waited 45 DAYS for a response from the support team. This should be an easy situation to solve, and there is no number or any other contact information provided to quickly add this information. 

It’s disappointing that every time I’ve inquired about something financial I have received such delayed responses....to me this is an essential service and I feel taken advantage of.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I needed help with issues stemming
from long term neglect. Was instead neglected by therapist. I understand that everyone is busy but a quick note to explain that you’re running behind is just common courtesy and would have made all the difference.  

I had signed up for 6 months. That’s a lot of cash I just had refunded to me.  Advice to developers:  don’t over promise.  If these therapists are moonlighting from their busy day jobs give us a realistic time frame for expecting a response.  This might have been the best experience ever but I’ll never know that because the therapist was apparently too busy to even toss off a quick note.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I have tried Talkspace now on two different occasions and it has been frustrating both times. My first therapist was great, but my inconsistent responses didn’t feel like they were worth $300 a month. Sometimes the conversations felt more like an acquaintance was texting me with things like “yeah totally,” and “lol good call!” I tried a second time because I had a specific issue I wanted to discuss, and after attempting to explain the situation and asking for professional input, I got a response of, “go with your gut!” Yeah, thanks. I also had to switch therapists three times after getting no responses. I love the concept, but I’ve tried it twice and been disappointed so now I’m cancelling for good.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"Honestly, I think this can be helpful for a lot of people. It’s important to remember, that this isn’t a texting conversation. There will be a delay. My issue is there was no consistency. It felt like providers only responded when they could and probably are focused on more patients in person (or now virtually) in their own practices. If there was consistency in responses and honestly helpful ones, I would have stayed with it. But in reality, you try one provider out, receive little to no response, and then change to a new one, get the same experience. You can go and spend $300 at the mall for the same type of therapy. At least at the mall you get something back.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I love my therapist and the concept of this service. However I have constant issues when it comes to scheduling sessions. The system and flow of this process is unnecessarily complex and the automated system is constantly getting in the way and making it hard for me to schedule sessions. On numerous occasions this has caused me to miss weekly sessions. I have written in to customer support and have to wait days if not over a week before I hear back. The lack of timely assistance and the general technical weirdness may very well cause me to delete this app. If I could keep my therapist and move on from Talkspace, I absolutely would.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"First let me start off by saying I never received any services they claim to provide... my “therapist” hardly ever responded and if she did it was a day late. Never did a live video session, never was even asked how I’m doing. Then I decided to cancel my subscription and ask for a full refund (common sense, right? Since I received absolutely nothing they said they provide.). Ended up getting less than half of my money back. This is the saddest scam, it’s supposed to help people who are asking for and needing help and instead doesn’t care at all about your mental health and steal your money. This treatment is horrible and they only want your money- thieves. They rob you blindly, in a mask of pretending to help you.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I subscribed for four 30 minute sessions per month and when I tried to schedule one with my therapist, I was notified that he doesn't have any a lot open until three weeks after. If I have to do all four live video sessions within the last week of the month, what’s the point of finding a therapist? It is better to talk to my friend. Also when I messaged him about my feeling, his response is often slow and perfunctory. He never addressed the real issue and only replied one or two sentences even if my message is very long. I feel this app or at least this therapist is not taking their customers seriously and is very unprofessional as a counseling agent.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"After a series of questions were asked by the matching agent in order to ensure I found the right therapist for my needs - I chose one that seemed like a great fit. His initial response to the information that I provided was that he was excited to work with me and would respond the following day after some thought. That was now a number of days ago, I’ve followed up multiple times as well as reached out to customer support - and somehow, it’s just been crickets. Not sure how the app functions if the fee paid is for the absence of any reply - but I’m hoping others have had better luck and that my experience is the exception rather than the rule.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"It’s a good thing I’ve been in *ok* enough of a place so that the input I got from talkspace’s therapists didn’t send me into a downward spiral. If you’re interested in therapists lazily launching unthoughtful platutudes at you, then Talkspace is for you. Or if you want them to ignore you for a couple days - also this is the app for you! If you want to write about an event that hit you hard one morning and have your therapist respond “yeah, that’s a lot. Well, have a good day at work” then this app is for you. If that therapist didn’t interpret your response of “wow great thanks” as sarcasm and replied with a thumbs up emoji, you’ll love Talkspace. It’s trash, and I’ve read that their therapists aren’t very fairly treated either. Avoid.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I’ve been disappointed with Talkspace from the beginning. The therapist I was matched with told me NOT to use the guaranteed response time feature because it doesn’t accommodate her schedule, so any response I got was either hurried and vague or took days to receive. I sent two separate emails to customer service regarding my concerns and three weeks later, no response. I would highly discourage anyone seeking mental heath guidance from using this app. Customer service is nonexistent, and the guaranteed response feature that we pay for is obviously not a guarantee. I started an account with BetterHelp at the same time as I did with Talkspace and have found it to be a much safer and effective answer to online therapy.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up 2 days ago and already have already cancelled my subscription. I’ve had nothing but issues. After paying $380+ they offered me $252 as a refund, when NO Services were rendered. This means, Talkspace wants a $150 transaction fee from people who aren’t paying attention to what they paid, and the refund amount offered. Further, Talkspace threatens that if you don’t take the $252 they offer it could take up to a month to receive your refund they offer. It’s a completely unethical practice. Regrettably, Talkspace is trying to take advantage (messing with the heads and wallets) of those who have mental health issues. It’s truly UNBELIEVABLE!!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This is my first month with Talkspace and my experience has been negative enough for me to cancel my subscription.

I matched with a therapist on 7/17 and I didn’t receive a message until the 25th. She regularly promised responses that she never followed through on.

She then sent a form letter telling me that she was leaving Talkspace and that I would be matched with a new counselor. I know it was a form letter because it reads “Hello there, I wanted to let you know that I am going to be leaving the Talkspace platform as a provider on (insert your last day here).”

I was then matched with another counselor who has yet to respond to any of my messages. That was a week ago.

After almost a month on Talkspace I have received a total of THREE messages relevant to my therapy. I’m so humiliated that I shared personal things with a service that clearly doesn’t respect how difficult it was. Please do not make my mistake. Message-based therapy may be a good option, but Talkspace isn’t it.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"No money, no help. Funny how managing mental health is critical, but only if you can pay for it. It’s not important enough that there are any free apps with professionals. This app could have provided super limited free options, like being able to talk to a therapist 1x-3x/month. Forget a monthly subscription, I’d pay $10-$20 for a session every time I felt I need it. I don’t need multiple times a weak. I was in a very and place, still am, & was hoping this app could be a beacon of hope, a light in the darkness. All of the plans were ridiculously expensive. I know a therapist’s time is valuable, but it’s no wonder so many people struggle to manage their mental health.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Most of the providers don’t even have video appointments available for weeks. The therapists are always late to respond over texts. One told me “set up a video appointment to talk about it” instead of actually responding. Another just never responded at all. Save your money and go to a therapist on your own once or twice a month for the money. Also when I first set up my account they couldn’t reset my password (not sure how that even happened) for over a week - I tried and emailed multiple times and it turns out they lost my email or something like that. Just please don’t spend your money on this service. I really regret it.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up for Talkspace when I was feeling extremely low and needed help, guidance, and direction. The app was SO quick to take my money (almost immediately upon sign up) but were extremely delayed on actually verifying my information. Now, I’ve paid $300+ for a month of counseling but can’t even access my account. There isn’t even a customer service phone number and the email is one mass customer service account. I’ll be disputing this payment with my bank, and cancelling my subscription. Work on your actual customer service and try to not look so money hungry next time and I might give you another shot.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

My first therapist didn’t show up to our sessions, my second also seems to have super limited availability like 5am or 9 at night.  Three weeks into using the app I still haven’t had a session.  But I have tried to share what’s going on via text.  I don’t blame the therapists, I am guessing Talkspace is paying them very little and this is a side gig for all of them.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

When I toes to first therapist that my family was concerned because of my constant criticism and negativity, she asked if I had tried “being more positive”... GeE wHy didn’t I tHiNk of ThAt. Really?  Had I been able to “be more positive”, why am I paying for therapy?!?

The second one seemed like a flake. Tried to schedule in-person visits twice, confirmed on my end—“9:30 on Wed sounds great!  It’s in my calendar”—and then dude never shows up. “I’m sorry, I didn’t think you had confirmed.” Huh???  I am done with trying to do the the app way. Going back to analog for therapy.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I’m not sure what they think having a “matchmaker” is a good way to go about finding a therapist. It says it’s a real person but you get automated sounding replies. Sometimes they respond right away, sometimes it’ll take until the next day for them to respond. Does not seem efficient at all. I much rather just search for therapists on my own and have the freedom to read bios and decide on my own. And the long wait in between replies is annoying. I signed up and within 48 hours cancelled everything and got a refund for my initial payment. Not at all worth the $260 a month.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I had a benefit through EAP for “6 sessions” of talkspace and tried to use it. Apparently that’s to text a few sentences to a therapist who only replies every other day. And it’s not real live therapy unless you pay high fees, they won’t tell you what they are until you “use up your 6 lame text sessions with a random person” even if you have good mental health coverage under your insurance! They wouldn’t let me choose live therapy, only replied to emails 2-3 days later and didn’t clearly answer questions. I’ll just wait on a real therapists list to be seen and save this expensive texting only crap for someone else.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I downloaded this app under the delusion that it would somehow replace my in-person therapy now that the pandemic has made it impossible to go into an office. After a few weeks of using it, I am pretty disappointed in the therapist-patient relationship experience.

I don’t know if Talkspace has enacted some kind of character limit for their therapists’ responses, but I could bare my entire soul in a huge message and my therapist will give me a one sentence response. Usually it’s just to regurgitate something basic stuff you already know. This is not helpful at all. 

If you are looking for real therapy, this app is not it. Unless you go for the expensive video sessions, I just don’t see this app helping at all. It’s more like a digital journal that occasionally talks back to you or like talking to a magic 8 ball. 

Talkspace really needs to make it clear that this app is not a solution for people who need real help. Trying to pass off this service as “therapy” is irresponsible and wrong.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

I just took 1 session and the application marked 2, I claimed and expressed this concern with my therapist, he was almost never available and was not following up this concern, then 3,4, and even 5, yes 5 appointments were marked as used. When I did not even scheduled them, I claimed directly to TalkSpace, cause at that point I thought the therapist was marking them ( I listed trust sorry!) and the response from them was even worst, they told me 1) sorry we can not go back if it already look like used 2) you need to use them with the same therapist (who was never available). If I can give 0 I will do it.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

The first wasn’t a right fit, the second stopped using the platform, the third was a scheduling nightmare (cancelled our first session 5 minutes before our session was set to begin)... how is this app actually helping people if it’s such a struggle to connect in the first place?",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

The third therapist was also unresponsive and didn’t confirm our video appointment after yet another intake session on the app. I wasted almost 3 weeks of time, I wanted it to work, I wanted to love it.

The primary method of communication is email. Customer service responds in two to three days with canned responses that do not address the issue. No phone number is given and there is no initiative to help. For a therapy service, the billing process causes more anxiety than the therapy cures. Further, 40 days after I canceled my account I was charged. No explanation was given and I received an email that I would be charged again—despite canceling 40 days prior.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Advertisement makes it seem like talkspace will provide a therapist at your fingertips, like a friend you can call or text anytime. The truth is, while you can send as many messages, voice messages, and video messages as you like, the therapist will not respond like one would think. Once or twice daily, maybe. Which means if you need feedback sooner rather than later, you’re out of luck.

Not to mention it’s way overpriced. $3,120/year for the basic plan. That’s $260/month. Wild. Better off just finding a good friend you can vent to and using the bloom app $60/year which will allow self-reflection and therapy techniques.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

It took me 3 weeks to go through that process and was not helped at all.

I’ve written to support multiple times and no one has responded in the past 3 days - unacceptable. The therapists are great but the app and the support have a lot of issues they need to fix before it’s worth actually using.

This is a fair warning to not prepurchase packages as there will be issues with getting access to them. It has glitches on me every other week with little to no support.

Don’t make the same mistake I did.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"TLDR - Talkspace doesn’t match you with a therapist based on needs or specialty. They therapists do not respond within 24 hrs and when they do respond it is usually with canned replies that may or may not be relevant to you or the info you’ve shared. A talk bot therapy platform actually functions better and you can find those for free.

I tried switching providers and reaching out to customer service based on these issues and got nowhere. After three weeks I’m out $200 and have received one message from a therapist suggesting visualization and breathing techniques.

She also took days to respond, didn’t answer any questions I had about how to do our therapy appointments, would take hours and hours to reply if at all. When I decided to cancel my plan they didn’t even fully refund me what I paid to sign up. They advertise as being able to speak to a therapist right away and that is completely untrue.

It’s been 2 weeks since I posted my thorough response. It’s also been a week since I opened up a ticket with support about this issue and have also not received any feedback regarding the issue.

For a mental health service you’d think they would be a little sensitive to their customer’s needs as some may need emotional support but they are not. I will now have to find a more local and attentive therapist to respond to my needs.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Indeed, it was too good to be true. The therapists we encountered were trash and honestly felt like bots - they send canned messages, infrequently. They also pull the ol’ bait & switch by promising video sessions (which you pay for in advance) and then saying “oh, too bad, your thearapist doesn't have any availability for them.”

My partner and i were in crisis and they take advantage of it. We paid close to $400 bucks, but you couldn't pay me enough to use it again. Seriously, don’t fall for it like we did - you’ll walk away feeling taken advantage of.

So, I looked into this app and when the prices per week were realized as too costly and insurance is not accepted...I was just told thank you and nothing more. I actually feel worse than before trying out your service.

I emailed Talkspace for support in regard to the provider no-show and was sent an auto reply that did not address my concern.

And they count any text message as a session. So the therapist would ask me “how are you doing?” And is say “I’m ok” and I’d get a message from the app saying “you just competed a session.” Also, when ever I had a session I couldn’t easily find the dang  live session to join. You’d think it would come up right on the main page, but nope… the app needs a lot of work.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"My company offers this for free so I gave it a shot.  For context I have been to more traditional therapy at a few points in my life. 

I spent a lot of time back and forth in the chat just trying to get a 10 minute intro appointment (the app lists time slots that as available which are not).

The 10 minute intro session felt like being grilled at the DMV, the guy had to look at his notes to even remember my name and why I wanted to speak with him. Very curt and frankly unwelcoming, especially given the sensitive nature of the questions. 

The icing on the cake is the therapist then quit the platform a few weeks later, leaving me to start this stupid process all over again, which I’m not going to bother with even if it was free for me. 

This is just my opinion but it’s pretty ethically messed up to try to funnel anyone struggling with mental health into this awful experience.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

I was charged the first month fee and was excited to get started. I sent a message to my first match and eagerly waited for a reply. 3 days later and still no response- not even a ‘hello’.

My second match was kind enough to reply, but after a few days of back and forth 1 message per day, determined there wasn’t room in their schedule. 

Since I never actually received any help or service from the app at this point, I submitted a ticket asking if a partial refund would be possible. 3 days later and still no response.

So essentially I paid over $200 to make no progress, be ignored, and feel worse than I did before downloading the app.

 I sincerely hope others that have used the app have had better luck than me.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I purchased four live sessions but found that  after two sessions I was unable to book my additional two. Customer services stated that I needed to update payment details and make additional payments prior to accessing the sessions I had already paid for. In addition customer support initially took two days to reply to my question. After nearly a week I have not been permitted to schedule the sessions I have already purchased. 

I believe online therapy has the ability to reach people where traditional models haven’t, but Talkspace in my case caused more frustration that it ameliorated.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I have attempted to use TalkSpace for the better part of two months. The first therapist I had took an entire week off one day at a time with no notice. The second was non engaging. I have attempted to reach out to customer service twice (since July) and still have not received a response two months later. This is very discouraging. I would not recommend this app at all. There are others to try that, from my experience, have better customer service. I am still waiting to speak to customer service. Horrible company and horrible therapists interaction and lack of actual engagement.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,You’re honestly better off going to the self help section of a bookstore than using this app. I paid $270 to get three lame cookie-cutter one-size-fits-all texts per week from my “therapist”. You don’t get more than a text per day from therapists and they rarely if ever have anything to do with what you texted them. It is trite advice you can find online for free. Even tried changing therapists... same issue. They spend all of two minutes responding to you even if you poured your heart out. It is a side hustle. Emphasis on hustle. If it was actually good... they probably wouldn’t need so many commercials.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I will never be using Talkspace therapy app again, and I also would advise you not to. They tried to charge me $236 for a month, and when I asked for financial support, their customer support told me the best they could do was a 25% off REFUND after I payed (after telling me the free trial was all they could do). They eventually told me they “forgave” my past due charges, so I guess they initially still expected me to pay the $236 I never agreed to?? Try any other service instead (BetterHelp actually has financial assistance, for example). I actually found the therapist to be helpful, but I will never use a service that treats their customers like this.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I gave it a try after a friend recommended, I had used Better Help and I was very happy but my friend insisted this app was better and I wish I never listened to her because this app is a scam!! Paired for the first month and never got a response from the first match by the time I was rematch my time had ran out and I had to pay extra for a video call even when the first counselor was at fault. The second counselor was amazing but after all that I didn’t want to continue with the app so I canceled the membership. Then out of the blue I got charged again, I filed a dispute but was not refunded the full amount",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"My plan (through my insurance) had unlimited texting and video chat. But when I had my first video session with a therapist it wanted me to pay $65. I decided to go ahead and pay it and then contact customer support for a refund (as my therapist suggested🙄). I shouldn’t have listened to her. It has been a week now and I have gotten NO RESPONSE. So I just lost that money apparently. Thanks a lot Talkspace. I have canceled my subscription.

**EDIT**
I forgot to mention that the session I had to pay $65 for was only 30 MINUTES. I used to get 1hr in-person therapy for $20 a session. This app/company is a joke. I don’t recommend it at all.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Unless you like to be lied to and have your money stolen don’t get this. When you sign up your given 3 different plans. I believe it was $66,$75,$99. I chose the lower plan because I didn’t care for video chatting. But then they had told me I was going to be covered by my insurance provider. Next this i know $260 is pulled from my bank account without ever being told about it. Haven’t even had a chance to use the service and am attempting to get a refund for the service I haven’t even got to use for 1 second. Next time please inform people what you are gonna actually charge before you take their money.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Customer service says it can take up to 7 days to respond, yet they can keep employees full time to sign up new customers.

I was billed for a month and I wanted to change to a lesser plan starting the next month, however, Talkspace changed my plan immediately and still charged me the higher amount.

Because I was on the lesser plan, my therapist was forced to choose between either not responding or not getting paid.  That is unfair.  And it is also unfair to make paying customers wait a week to respond when you have stolen their money and downgraded service.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Save your money, honey. The text interface is clunky. Signed up and went through onboarding and was assured I could speak with someone immediately. I’ve been on the platform for a week and the therapist has poor reading comprehension and contradicts himself in every message. He’s yet to address my concerns! Normally in therapy there are some ramp up sessions to establish a mutual understanding on each side. This platform feels like you’re pulling teeth to get them to get basic facts right, let alone what you’re trying to work through. This isn’t worth your time, especially in a pandemic.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This company is shady. I matched to a therapist who wasn’t able to figure out the “video technology” supposedly and was encouraged to only communicate through text. Texting is not therapy and this is inappropriate for a company to tout themselves as mental health treatment. I tried to cancel my subscription but the company doesn’t give me that apt ion (I followed instructions and the buttons I’m supposed to press aren’t there -surprise surprise). My review is being typed in white writing as I’m typing this I can’t even see the words. Selected, copied, and pasted into a note so I could make sure I was seeing correctly. What is this company up to?",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This feels like a scam, they get you signed up and paired with therapist who’s availability is weeks out. Then therapist changes dates around again and I’m told through CS ticket (no option to call) that sorry your out $400 we don’t roll over the therapy slots you paid for. Sign up for the cheapest possible subscription you can and verify your therapist can see you within timeframe. Basically the onus is on you to ensure all scheduling activities are met within subscription window. Beware because this company will absolutely pick your pocket",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Do not get this app if you are actually looking for help. The first therapist I spoke with didn’t actually give any advice. She instead repeated back what I was saying and said she understood. I needed actual help. The next therapist asked how I would like to proceed and I said I wasn’t sure because this was the first time I was reaching out for help and he never responded. I tried to reach out to their customer support and never heard anything. Couldn’t get a refund. Horrible. Especially when someone is needing real help. Don’t waste your time, money, and self worth with this app. There are better options.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Even though my therapist was amazing talk space ruined my experience. I have been overcharged for services and have requested copies of my invoices multiple times and still have yet to get them. For two weeks I’ve been trying to get in touch with customer service there is no one 800 number to talk to them and they don’t respond to emails. Therapist are amazing but be careful on how they charge you. I would recommend using traditional therapy with everything being on zoom you can have the same concept and don’t have to worry about over charging.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I like the therapist options I’ve been able to choose from but the chat function is not valuable to me and $400+ is exorbitant for 4 30 minute therapy session when I have insurance that covers them in network with longer sessions. After I cancelled my subscription Talkspace charged me another $400 which I had to dispute for a refund and then they cancelled my 4th session I had already paid for. I appreciate my therapist but I will NEVER use Talkspace again or recommend to friends and family. In fact I will be warning them away. So disappointed in this company.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,These people are constantly over charging me. They don’t give refunds either they’re customer support is garbage literally nonexistent. They charged me 3 times in my first month even though I constantly tried to keep up with their customer support through email it was a dead end. I found a number you can call and it just sends you to voicemail nobody actually calls you back. They’re taking advantage of people who aren’t in a good headspace. If you’re thinking about using this app just go to another one. This is ridiculous.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I was very specific about what I was hoping for. I had two therapists lose track of who I was and what I had sent them - they both sent canned responses that didn’t actually reflect that they had read anything I submitted. One even admitted he got too many new clients assigned to him and couldn’t keep track. It was very impersonal and actually created more harm for me. When I contacted support to cancel and get a refund, there is a 21 day wait to hear back from them. Maybe Talkspace used to be good, but they’ve outgrown their ability to effectively provide therapy.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"My first therapists never showed up to the live sessions so I switched therapists, but the my account was no longer associated with my insurance.  I have left many messages for weeks for support to look into the insurance issue, but I never received a response through email or in the app.  They don’t have a phone number (always a bad sign).

This space has made me more frustrated and anxious than when I first thoughts of turning to therapy.  

Save yourself the frustration and go the old fashion way.  After covid, I’m sure more therapists will do online sessions anyway.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I just think if you advertise being able to message a licensed professional 24/7, you should get a response more than once a week. I started my free trial during COVID-19, so maybe many people are trying this method for the first time. It just was not the fit I was hoping for, and that is really the only experience I can speak for. However I did read multiple reviews that had similar options. I would just do more research than I did when it comes to mental health services provided via the phone.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Although the app concept seems great, the problem is talkspace has no control over the extremely unprofessional providers to contract with. After paying them $300 for the privilege of booking a month of sessions, I have had zero sessions because I have been touched a grand total of five times by providers. They literally just do not show up to appointments. And all you can do is message talkspace and get a generic customer service response. It absolutely stinks and I would not recommend this to anybody.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"There is no way to cancel my account, it says to go to “my account” page and there it will give me an option to cancel but that page isn’t linked, I tap “my account” and nothing happens, I’m never redirected to a new page. I haven’t used the service, I created an account because it said there was a free trial, a therapist text me to explain that this wasn’t traditional therapy at all and I said thanks but no thanks and now I cannot cancel. I’m going to snap if I get billed for anything. This is horrible that they would put a woman suffering from depression while she’s pregnant through another headache. Absolutely ridiculous.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"Absolutely terrible. Had to change a therapist just days after starting the process. And once I got my second one I thought things were improving but now I wish I could switch again. The therapists do not care about building any kind of connection with you. They don’t put much thought, time or effort into their responses. They take forever to respond back and when they do they give short, meek replies that help nobody. This app is not real therapy. You will not improve using this app. Not worth the money at all!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I think it’s a overpriced for the limited service it provides. I joined because I needed someone to talk to. I quit after my therapist didn’t respond for the first 72 hours. There are plenty of strangers who won’t respond to my messages for free 😆. Don’t need to pay someone $280 a month for that.

**Also it’s extremely frustrating that it is 280$/ month until you try and cancel or leave a bad review. In which case it the price is dramatically reduced and free time if offered. Reminds me of my internet providers 😂. It is unconscionable profit seeking by preying on vulnerable people.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I had really high hopes for this app but unfortunately, they don’t respond on the time they give you. They’re not really helpful and the matches are bad. Great concept, horrible execution. I think I could help myself by read a self help book more than any advice/response that someone could offer through talk space. I can’t believe how much money to get one disconnected, disingenuous response (if they do respond).

1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. 

I downloaded this app a couple weeks ago & I have yet to speak to a real human for support in finding a new provider. My provider was completely unprepared for our first meeting (showed up 20 minutes late to our video session & then left her camera facing the ceiling during our session), so I submitted a ticket to customer support about a week ago to find a new provider & receive a reimbursement for a session that was a complete waste of time. & I have yet to receive a response.

2,"I wanted this app to work so badly. To pay $260 a month I expected for there to be an open line of communication with my therapist. Maybe setting up a time frame to communicate, but what I got was being told that they would try to get to me twice a day (if I was lucky). I ended up feeling ignored  and raw. I quickly figured out that this app is just a side hustle for therapist wanting to make extra cash. There was no plan, there was no constructive help, just opening up old wounds with no help with closure.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"The app was fine, but negative experience with my therapist. I definitely felt like she was just ticking the box in terms of responding within the designated time, including messages like “I have seen your message and will respond tomorrow”...and then didn’t respond the next day. 

It was helpful in the way that writing a letter expressing how you feel and then lighting it on fire is cathartic, but I wouldn’t recommend this service if you’re looking for a professional relationship with a counselor.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"If you’re thinking about it, don’t do it. I paid, got matched, booked an appointment, showed up for said appointment, waited for 20 minutes to have my therapist not show up, responding later that there was a glitch in the system and my appointment showed up as canceled. I got multiple notifications and emails to make sure I made it to my appointment though so I’m really confused how it showed up as canceled for my therapist. This was two weeks ago and I have contacted customer service three times now with no response about refunding my money.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The frustration over using (um, trying to use) this app has become overwhelming. You are required to pay for sessions as you schedule, then when the app doesn’t work, you can’t get a refund. I paid with insurance copay but then got NO session and was directed to reschedule and pay the Talkspace rate with no option to access insurance despite the fact that my insurance info was noted in my account. Two emails to Talkspace over the last week and NO RESPONSE. Whether it’s Talkspace it the app I can’t say but either way it has been a frustration disappointment. AND I remain short my copay which I can’t seem to get back.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app is terrible with the way it loads and sends data. 

So many times, the site will say “your therapist is off” but then the app says “working today” and gives no indication of time off. Or my messages don’t get delivered for days and days on end. It’s happened a number of times where they say “oh I didn’t see your messages for a couple of days”.

Ya’ll need fix y’all data delivery and manage “state” between the app and the website better. It’s very confusing for people who use the app. 

Are y’all using separate APIs with separate sets of data? 

Y’all seriously have to sort this out. This is a problem across the board, for all people who download and use the app. 

This app does the opposite of providing help. 

The website actually has correct data - or more complete looking data. 

Unbelievable, though not unexpected.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"True, it’s cheaper than “traditional” therapy, but it’s useless. Therapists were incompetent, they tried to raise subscription price after I’d signed up, and the support is a joke. After a couple huge failures in the form of therapists that made me feel like I was talking to a bad chatbot, they could find me no alternatives and I was left hanging (and paying the bill) for a rotating door of “therapists” that I wouldn’t trust with a cat let alone a human being. This was worse than doing nothing - I wasted dozens of hours and hundreds of dollars on a false hope.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

It wasn’t free and I had buy upfront to talk to therapist. I honestly wish I could speak to therapist. I am currently unemployed college student and struggling to stay above.

1,"I’m honestly shocked how basic and lackluster this service has been. It is way overpriced for what you get. I tried two different providers and had the same issues with sending an update with insights, goals, etc. and getting back one line responses. The “advice” was extremely basic or something any of your friends could offer - nothing insightful or thought provoking in the least, rarely did they even ask a question. In an attempt to commit to this, I signed up for a 3 month subscription and it’s a complete waste of money.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The only assurance I had that my second therapist wasn’t a bot was that she had an article on Psychology Today. The first never got past the intro message. It was a business week without any holidays for added context.

Validating is well and good, but when you’re parroting back to me what took paragraphs and paragraphs of painful introspection without giving tools on what to do, it’s not unlike punching someone in the nose and letting that person know they’ve got some red on them.

I wish I could get my money and two weeks back, but I don’t see that happening.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The initial match took about a day. Then the first provider I matched up never responded to me after a few days of trying I switched. Then the next provider introduced herself, got in an accident and never bother to chat again. I filed an issue with the app, decided to give it one last try and right after the last provider finally shared some useful thoughts the app without warning canceled my subscription telling me they’d refund me in 3-5 days.

I was in therapy for about 8 months and it was very helpful. Started going through some things recently and wanted to start again and the experience was so bad I feel horrible for even referring anyone to it since then.

2,"I tried this app and please, please, please do not confuse it with real therapy. If you are struggling with something big, go get actual help from someone who can be with you. This is an app where someone will text you once every few days and say- “oh interesting” and “why do you think that is?” It could be helpful to some, but it doesn’t hold a candle to in person therapy with someone who is focused on you.

1,"I've had such an awful experience on Talkspace and wondering why they're still in business! As a company providing mental health to people who desperately it, it's sad that they're rather stressing their patients out. After being matched to a new therapist, she has NEVER responded to my messages and doesn’t even have any availability for video calls in the next 3 weeks.

Almost 24 hours later and she still hasn’t responded and matched me with a therapist.

Mid speaking you shouldn’t have to worry that your private medical discussions are exactly what they should legally be… PRIVATE! 

Could I have switched to another provider? Sure! But I’m there in part because of trauma and trust issues….

1,My job was offering 3 free months of therapy and I was super excited because I was really at a low point in my life where I didn’t want but I really needed someone to talk to. My therapist was very interactive and not helpful whatsoever. There would be days or weeks where she hadn’t responded and when she did it was like she responded to parts or said things like “you’re just gonna have to deal with this one” after explaining how I felt or what was disturbing me.

1,"Honestly I thought that with virtual sessions and the ability to text it would be better than an in person session, especially during a pandemic. The worst part is to pay over $300 for a month of service and already the first text it says expect a response by 8:00pm and I get a response at almost midnight. Then the first and only 30 minute live chat for the month has to be rescheduled after waiting for over half of the session. Honestly at this point I would really like a refund. So disappointed.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Incompetence from therapists and all involved. The app itself is fine, but any humans involved have been unpleasant and actually damaging. The “matchmaker” was incredibly rude, and the therapist didn’t give me an ounce of attention until I told her I was quitting the app. I not once had a single therapy session. The therapist set-up a video call with maybe an hour notice and told me she was sorry that i couldn’t make it. Ummm...? 

This app made me incredibly anxious, feel hopeless, and sink deeper into depression the week I was trying it. I really don’t recommend it to anyone seeking mental help.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app is not worth it at all for how much is it. It is true that you can text your therapist anytime but just remember that you will get a reply way later when you may not be troubling with the same issue anymore. It is like texting a friend a question and waiting for them to reply, which can be very frustrating! Basically, it is hard to have a full conversation with your therapist, and it shouldn’t be how therapy works! The therapist is not helpful, either. The therapist I had basically gave me pointless and useless comments. Not recommended!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

Talk space has a 1 star review on BBB which is pretty safe to say its a scam. Its a shame to profit off of people searching for help is such a dark time. Shame on you talk space.

I wanted to see both a Therapist and a Psychiatrist, but not only is therapy the only service covered by insurance, but I paid $300 for a Psychiatry consultation and still have not been matched with a Psychiatrist for over 3 days.

1,For an app that is about mental health and communication you would anticipate there being a great customer service experience.. The only experience I am having is me festering in the annoyance of getting no response and having no direct contact to address a simple issue that could be resolved over the phone in 2 minutes. Requested my verification email to be resent at least 5 times and never received it so I can’t even log into my account to start my therapy 2 days after paying over $200!!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Once you put your credit card in there you cannot cancel. The directions for the app don’t work the way they say they will. The cancellation button is missing from the app and from the online profile. It is impossible to get help from their customer service team. I think this is fraudulent. Sorry I really wanted it to work. I’m having a terrible time here. I’ve been charged for sessions I have not had. It is charging me a Roni us Lee. It did not pick up my co-pay with my insurance. The counselor was flaky with her time. Not good.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"This is a lot more convenient than regular in person appointments. The fee/pricing schedule is a little odd though. The base plan just includes texting with therapist. It’s called Talkspace; not Textspace. I expect a weekly chat with a counselor to be a big part of therapy.

I had no issues with the therapist. My problems were related to the TS app and billing.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

After waiting several days, I cancelled my subscription and requested a refund. They did give me a partial refund but I still spent almost $30 for nothing.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Talk Space needs to stop advertising so heavily because their staff is overwhelmed. I have gone through like 5 therapists because they either barely respond or give a one or two sentence response when I have poured my heart out to this stranger. I finally found one that responded with a few paragraphs although I did wait a full weekend for a response. She seemed thoughtful and to my next entry she let me know she saw it and would reply in the morning.  No reply! So frustrating!!!!!! Thank God I had 4 free EAP sessions! Wouldn’t pay a penny for this!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I have used online therapy before and it was 100x better than what I’ve gotten through TalkSpace. My original therapist on this app did not seem to be reading what I was saying. So after a few days, I switched to a new therapist. Crazy thing is that the new guy I got is exactly the same way. I am basically paying a bunch of money for someone to sort of read my texts and reply in a generic and half-hearted way. Total waste of money. Do not bother. Go elsewhere if you want a therapist who cares and reads what you’re saying and actually has some sort of useful input.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app is hands down the biggest scam/rip off. I went out of my comfort zone to look for help when I needed it the most, I’ve never been one to even think about therapy. I struggled with finding a decent therapist here in Vegas, so I turned to this app. The “therapists” reply when they want which is once a day, and then you don’t hear from them for another couple of days. They stop talking to you AS SOON as you start. I seriously don’t understand how this app is even a thing let alone has good reviews. WASTE OF $300. I WILL NEVER TRUST THERAPY AGAIN.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Pray you dont have an issue when dealing with this app because it will take a minimum of 5days to sort it out. You can only email them and they will always give a pointless response to an easy problem that can be solved. So you wind up playing email tag until they decide they finally wanna do something. And if your problem is of the uptmost importance dont worry, because the more emails you send the further down in the queue you go, so in all never make a mistake.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I spent two weeks emailing back and forth with support regarding insurance, group video calls, and questions relating to family usage. The first support person was less than professional. The second I have 15+ emails with trying to get answers to things. If they had a chat feature at the very least this would have taken a day or two at the most. A call center or support.. a day. This application is really bad. I’m still. It even at the point where I have a therapist. If someone really needed help they would be in trouble.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The app sounds good in concept, but in reality I found it useless. They make you pay for a month at a time with no guarantee your therapist will respond to you. My therapist was super pushy about doing a video call. She asked good questions but never helped me work through my problems. I finally just asked point blank for suggestions for my anxiety and was ghosted.

2,"I first used this app last year in the midst of the pandemic and my therapist was outstanding. She replied every day with tools and feedback that helped more than any therapy I have ever used. I signed up again a week ago and wasn’t able to get the same therapist. The therapist I chose only gave me one reply of any substance over 4 days, so I opted to change. New therapist hasn’t responded at all. Probably will cancel subscription and try a different service.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Please save yourself the time and money. The providers on this app are swamped and rather than hire more therapists or making it impossible to match with therapists who have no available appointments (due to too many clients), the app just matches you with folks who end up being unresponsive and inattentive. If you’re looking for convenient therapy, just go the old fashioned route. They won’t even give a refund, only credit that you can put toward an additional month of terrible service.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Providers don’t even respond, or give short thoughtless answers hours later. Not worth the money. I liked my first provider, but after just a day she quit on me without any explanation ( but not after letting a full wasted day pass that I had to pay for). I chose a new provider and she gave short thoughtless answers. I requested a refund and they didn’t even provide me a full refund. I got a total of maybe 4 or 5 text messages sent and they still wouldn’t refund me. What a waste of time and money.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"If you’ve ever worked in sales you will recognize they use every trick in the book to get you to sign up. It seems pretty unethical for licensed therapists to be so manipulative to make a buck.

After determining they don’t take my insurance (or any insurance it seems, save for one plan), I wanted to forget my experience. And yet no one can tell me how to delete my account - and yes, Talkspace, there is a difference between deleting an account and canceling a non-existent subscription.

Their emails don’t even allow you to unsubscribe - the word “unsubscribe” is there but it’s not hyperlinked. Ever heard of the CAN-SPAM Act? Though given your blatant disregard for ethics I guess I shouldn’t be surprised you don’t care about the law. 

Do not waste your time with this app and whatever you do, do not enter any of your personal data into it.

Gross.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Absolutely zero customer service. Providers are allowed to cancel on you last minute multiple times. Providers have even communicated that they can’t figure out the app or have even said they are quitting.

You’re better off somewhere else.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I paid $260 for the month and the therapist i chose didn’t respond to me when i really needed advice. I figured out my problems on my own. I believe this was a total waste of money and i should of just scheduled an appointment with my therapist that ive gone to for years but I thought I’d try this because of COVID. I do not recommend this for anyone who needs advice or who needs to talk to someone if they are wanting therapy in a TIMELY manner. Just schedule an in person therapy appt with someone local. So sad this didn’t work because i really needed to talk to someone,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

I was offered a “refund” for less than what I paid, with the disclaimer that if I “waived” it I would not be entitled to any refund. So I threw away about $50 on absolutely nothing. This is an excellent business model if you have no conscious. Unfortunately I trusted that a mental health app that is so well known would be competent and caring, Talkspace is not.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I am so disappointed in Talk Space. The therapists are horrible.  They did not seem to read our last correspondence and kept asking the same questions over and over. Gave literally no advice. The communication is maybe one sentence, once a day. It made things worse for me. Instead of helping me, they made me feel bad and told me to figure out ways to fix the things that were wrong with me. I just can’t believe that this service is even legal. It should be reported to the BBB.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I have left a voicemail with talk space and have not heard back yet. It has been almost a week.

I signed up because I needed help. It took a very long time to get through the insane process to get connected with a doctor. I needed a psychiatrist but I was signed up through the psychology side of things. They charged me for that, then I switched to psychiatry and found out they do not treat ADD, which is what I told my “sign up helper” from the very beginning. I told her never mind and that they couldn’t help me.
Now I’ve been charged $700 with absolutely no follow up from them as to why I haven’t used the service. 

Be very careful with this app. They will take your money and not help you.

1,"What a disappointing experience , I felt I did better looking up my own research for free then paying for this sad excuse of therapy  , Did not fulfill anything I wanted , all my questions were answered with another question I paid $200 for someone to tell me “relax your muscles “ I recommend just seeing a therapist face to face and paying by the hour than using this app , it’s cheaper than paying $200 for less than 10-15 replies ,Don’t waste your time , schedule an actual appointment if your struggling with any mental set back ,",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Don’t waste your time or money if you have a support system of any type. I was looking for therapy to help address issues. No issues were addressed. Over the course of two weeks the only take away I received was how to properly take deep breaths.

When I finally find someone I was able to book video sessions with, and then waited a week for an appointment, the app wouldn’t work, leaving me having to reschedule for another week out.

I was then put with a matching agent and then ignored for days at a time again still with no therapist.

1,"Biggest waste of time. Don’t bother signing up if you are looking for a therapy solution, they guarantee responses but You’ll go days without a reply which is frustrating especially when they set expectations and do not meet them. The counselors must be overwhelmed because even when they do respond their replies are short, and unproductive. So you’ll go another few days without any real assistance. I’m extremely frustrated and if anything this has only made me loose faith in mental healthcare",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I tried this once got frustrated then they offered a discount. So I tried the service again.

It’s  just to limiting. Despite the promise of responsiveness, you get 1 to 2 responses a day 4 maybe 5 days a week. Imagine having a half hour conversation over 30 days. I don’t have that kind of patients. And that rate is very expensive. It’s cheaper to speak to a provider directly. I don’t recommend this service.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"While the idea of being able to talk with a therapist whenever you’d like throughout the day is great, it’s equally as frustrating to not get a response back for numerous hours and sometimes days later. For those that are struggling with mental health and need someone to talk to the pricing of Talkspace is too high without having insurance. The cost of $260 a month is only $15 less than my monthly car payment. There should be sliding fees or options for those that don’t have insurance.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

I’m trying to get my free account deleted so I can sign up through my company’s insurance, and I cannot do that with the lame instructions I got.

The service is aweful.

The first therapist never responded to my messages. Not even once.

The second therapist attempted to get me to pay her directly (outside of Talkspace) and wouldn’t talk to me through the app.

Talkspace customer support is useless. They just tell you to “keep trying new therapists”. But every therapist I matched with was either never online or tried to scam additional money out of me.

I thought maybe this would be a cool way to relive some “pandemic blues” I’ve been feeling. But instead I just got ripped off by Talkspace.

Do your research. Many of the positive reviews on here are fake (google it).

Total scammers.

One therapist even refereed to telehealth as “not real therapy”.

My provider in the middle of our sessions she told me she quoted Talkspace because she didn’t felt it was good. Why?

- good rates for 6 months of “1 text message a day” 

The Bad:
- You can only view your therapist matches *ONCE* before they are gone forever. 
- If you don’t choose a therapist and stick with them forever you’ll be relegated to the “At this time we do not/may not have another match readily available...”

After many attempts to find an appropriate therapist, we had to give up. However, when we asked for refund or at least a prorated refund, the customer service folks kept saying the were overwhelmed with support requests.

It’s a lie.

They are quick to take your money and extremely slow and full of excuses when you request a refund. This is one of the worst and slowest customer service responses I’ve experienced.

Their customer service is surprisingly unhelpful. I wanted to like this app and super excited to try it out, but it turned out that it’s a big waste of time and it did add even more stress. Do not waste your time on this service.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"As someone who struggles with bipolar disorder, I was looking forward to trying this out. My first therapist wasn’t a fit so I reached out to customer service to find a new one. They have been COMPLETELY unresponsive. It’s been a week and I still haven’t heard from anyone.
I am struggling and feel totally abandoned by this service. If I was in a more precarious mental state it would have been too late. 
I’ve cancelled my membership and will be demanding a refund.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I’ve never felt so low before and needed help. I finally reached out and the therapist has only messaged me 3 times in 48 hours. None of which are even talking about what I explained was going on to make me feel so low. I even took a depression and anxiety test that was provided from the therapist, scored severe in both categories and have yet to hear anything about those from her. Now I’m struggling to get back my money. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"They lure you in by offering a “generous discount” promising a back and forth with experienced therapists. I had the app for a week and received 3 responses from two different therapists over that period. When I contacted customer service, an automatic email was generated with quick links to cancellation and refunds. I guess a refund of $105 of the $140 is about the same price I’d pay for one session covered by insurance, but I still don’t think it’s worth it.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The app is terrible, the customer service is worse, and when you (inevitably) realize that you’ve wasted your money you cannot get a refund. I attempted to do a video call and it crashed about 8 minutes in. But, to Talkspace, I used one of my 30 minute sessions for it. It’s a complete joke and I’m in worse shape now than I was when I started the app. Don’t waste your time, energy, or money on this app. I wish I could rate it 0 stars.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,The therapist it matched me with never replied or responded so I was given the option to switch to another one — except there weren’t any others available so it took me to the “matching agent” which is basically a bot and just ran me around in circles. I never got the help I needed & it kept wanting me to input my insurance info which I already did because my insurance is supposed to cover this service. Overall a giant waste of time!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,If you have any issues and need to contact customer service they don’t answer you for WEEKS between responses. The only way to contact customer service is via email. They have no phone number. I had an issue with billing and it was the most frustrating thing to get in contact with someone. I can’t wait to get refunded to use another platform.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I’ve been waiting for an answer to a simple insurance question for 7 days. It’s now interfering with my ability to talk to my therapist. Every time customer service writes me back it is not in answer to my question but instead generic responses. When I respond it takes another two days to get an email back that still has no answers. I’m not getting help so it’s useless. More stress than help.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,I tried Talkspace for a month.  I found my therapist to be a huge disappointment.  Most of our communication was through text and I felt like many of her responses to my issues and concerns were canned responses that she just copied and pasted as appropriate.  I did not feel like the advice was tailored to my specific needs.  I’m sure there are some good therapist on Talkspace and perhaps I just wasn’t matched with the right person.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I don’t really review apps but this is targeting people seeking help so I felt that it was important.

I can only speak about my experience so far which is about a week. It has felt like a waste of ~$400/month. My providers never respond and the only thing you’re left with is a breathing exercise app. If I would do it again, I would just go to a traditional therapy provider. At least they give you attention.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I had really high hopes for this app being a better therapy app that I could use as it provided a use of insurance option but I’ve tried talking to 2 therapists so far and neither have responded to me. I’ve been waiting 3 days for a response after signing and nothing. How am I supposed to set up instant messaging if my therapist would even respond? I am LESS than disheartened by this app and completely dissatisfied.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I wanted to try this out because my regular therapist was unable to do virtual sessions right now. The first provider I was paired with never responded even though she read my message. The second one basically said, “That is a tough problem. Have you ever tried just giving it time?” Ground breaking. This was an absolute letdown and waste on money. Wouldn’t recommend it to anyone looking for actual advice or helpful tools.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"There should be a way to filter therapists based on the type of therapy they do. I.e., if they are okay with messages only because that is the subscription I'm on. After dumping 200$, I have still yet to receive any therapy due to therapists being only available for video sessions and not being open to therapy through messages. Waste of time and money, since I couldn't even get a full refund.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Do not use this app. I paid over $600 because I was so determined to get help for my awful mental health AND NEVER GOT A RESPONSE FROM A THERAPIST!! I even waited two whole days AND switched therapists because I thought maybe one was too overwhelmed and couldn’t respond? But nope the other “therapist” never responded either. In the process of trying to get a refund and I can’t even get a response from this company. Don’t waste your hard earned money on this scam of an app.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"Talkspace is a good idea. However, at least in my experience, the therapists are not helpful nor caring. They signed up for this but don’t do their jobs. Perhaps they should stick to their day jobs at their own practice or whatever else they do because clearly they don’t have time to respond something meaningful or insightful, that is if they respond at all.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"First off. It took me 10 minutes just to give a good password because it says my password was too weak. Just try adding Sign In with Apple or something like that. 

Second. As a user. I want to easily be able to open the app and schedule a session. I still don’t know how to do that. This looks like a good app but you guys are just making it more difficult that it is.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I reached out for weeks to get someone to help me and no one has still responded. My therapist went on vacation in which I couldn’t use my paid credits during this time and they never rolled over my paid credits even though this wasn’t something on my end. Now, my subscription is cancelled and I have unused credits. No one will get back to me or help me with the situation. Therapist is great, platform— not great.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I cancelled my subscription and am still being charged. I’ve tried to their reach customer service but only way to contact them is by submitting a ticket and I am still waiting for this ticket to be resolved. I am extremely frustrated that I’m being charged every month and only way to stop this is to cancel my credit card permanently and get a new one.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I would not recommend this app if you are seeking real help. These people do not respond. So far I’ve been through two providers and both were terrible on their response time. The last never responded to my last message and then took time off for about two weeks. I got on here for help and so far no one has been able to help. Terrible!! I would give zero stars if I could.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This is a follow up to my earlier review.  After contacting support 3 separate times and getting no help with a therapist match, I decided to cancel and go with BetterHelp instead.  However I just found out that Talkspace charged my credit card in the meantime despite never even assigning me a therapist.  So now I also need to deal with a credit card charge back.  This company is a complete waste of time.  I’d suggest using a competitor instead.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"Had high hopes for some more convenient talk therapy. Didn’t even get past the counselor who was supposed to match me with an actual counselor. We were messaging, she went offline and I haven’t heard back from her in a few days. I guess dependability isn’t in their qualifications.  Hopefully, other people who are seeking help have a better experience!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up for a month, the first therapist responded to me and then sent me a plethora of information that it was overwhelming. She said I should be speaking 90% of the conversation. So I decided to switch therapists well the next one only responded to the intro and then not again after I sent 3 messages over 2 weeks!! Hate that I wasted my money on this! I was really hoping this would be a good option but it was not!!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"If you want help, look somewhere else.  If you choose this application you will end up with therapists that do not respond and/or do not care.  I was in a bad place when I decided to try this application and I am in a worse place afterward.  For a company that advertises a place where you can talk to a therapist, they do a terrible job providing therapists that will actually talk with you.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I’d forgot I’d even subscribed to this app. That’s how long the responses took. Just another app on my phone I never clicked on. They’d been charging me $316 for three months (I should’ve noticed) but also, I feel like if you have clients that aren’t responsive, shouldn’t you have to check on them? Instead of just continuously charging an account that is INACTIVE? This is very disappointing & I’d never refer this app to anyone in real need of help.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Fake therapists and terrible app support. AVOID.  Terrible experience. My therapist worsened my condition by giving me wrong information and Not being responsive. The app itself doesn’t work properly as I was not able to book video sessions, I reached out the support and after four weeks and five emails they never help me so I canceled my subscription. 
Stay away.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"My therapist RARELY replied and seemed to never provide any help, just sent blank worksheets and, when I sent them back completed, never bothered to read what I wrote. He never bothered to keep up with me, and i felt like i had to reintroduce myself and my desires every time we spoke. Don’t expect more than a sporadic message every couple of days and little personal attention. I feel cheated and robbed. DO NOT waste your money.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I do NOT recommend for severe depression and severe anxiety.  I may be a one off but it’s good for peoples first time in therapy. Not for people who are past the talking about your trauma and with actual brain damage. I actually felt very taken advantage of and very hurt by the lack of response and empathy from providers. I will never… EVER come back to his app. It’s done me more harm then good, mentally. Maybe it’s just me 🤷‍♀️. Then I deserve to be this way mentally. Bye talkspace",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"First therapist I had basically stood me up three times. After awhile decided I’d try it again and we did back and forth on scheduling for days, even though there is a booking area no one seems to use this. Has this problem with both therapists. The idea is great if they could get it together!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I acknowledge that the therapist have their in person clientele. However, for this to be a mobile service there’s no reason why i should be waiting DAYS before getting a response. There’s no reason i should be getting an email from the system canceling a session because a counselor didn’t respond. I spent money just to never receive any service. I am disgusted and convinced this isn’t to help at all.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I wish I had a way to give 0 stars. My experience has been awful, the communication from anyone on the app. They took $130 from me and have yet to respond to any of my support messages, it’s been 4 days.

I will never trust another app like this.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I’ve been a Talkspace user for years and dealing with their customer support is horrible. It takes forever to get a reply and when they do reply, the agent doesn’t even read and understand what you’re asking about. They could be great if their customer service was above abysmal quality.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,I feel this is very expensive for the little few sentences or a paragraph you may receive back.  It didn’t help me at all.  I know myself to take a walk and get fresh air.   I needed counseling for PTSD and grieving of several loved ones that passes unexpectedly.  So unless you just want a chat for 300$ a month I guess it’s worth it to someone.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The therapists in this app are decent. But the technology itself is horrible. None of the scheduling features work properly so you have to manage it manually. Also the customer support is completely useless. The people behind the company should be ashamed of themselves. Mental health services is so critical during Covid, and building a terrible technology for profit is just exploiting people who are in need. Be better.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Few things in life are a complete waste of time and money. Matching agents are sales consultants, it’s like talking to a AOL instant messenger prototype. The counselor I had for 1 session was great. Talk space originally told me chat only sessions were not an option. Well, they are. Sign up if you want one response a week after sending a well tailored, concise thoughtful message to your provider. Read The NY Times article as well, it’s insightful.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This service is awful.  Have spent over two months trying to schedule and never ever gets accepted.  Then try to change providers but the software doesn’t work gets locked on a blank page.  Have opened three tickets and never had anyone respond or do anything for the tickets.

Nobody is behind this technology and I think they are trying to give us a breakdown.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I’m absolutely disappointed with this app. My therapist’s decision whether to respond or not is spotty at best. When she does respond, I receive a quick, generic message void of any real feedback. Monday she messaged me that she is quitting the forum and I need to find another therapist. When I looked for ways to contact the powers that be to cancel my subscription, I found an email format. I have not gotten a response from them yet either. Thank god I'm not in crisis.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"Although I think resources like this are needed, I feel that Talkspace clearly has their own agenda and looking to capitalize on this segment of the medical field. They advertise that they accept insurance but then the resources for those using insurance are limited. I was really hoping this would be a great option.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app is wayyyyyyyy to expensive to be so slow moving. I didn’t click with my assigned counselor and wasn’t even able to schedule a video session to try to remedy that. The app is too buggy for me to feel comfortable sharing my information. In their introduction videos they try to up sell you, which seems really tasteless in a “How to Talk to Your Therapist” video.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"So far, it’s been only okay. Been on a few months but unfortunately it’s very impersonal and you’re just left in the lurch if you’re therapist goes on vacation or anything.

1,"It’s easy to get a live person when they want you to sign up, but watch out after you give them a try. They billed me for a second month and I am unable to book any live sessions.

The therapist says he doesn’t handle that aspect. $400 gone and nothing to show for it.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,M Each time you go to edit some text the writing bar will go straight back to the end of the text. So if you want to edit something at the beginning of what you wrote you’re pretty  screwed having to constantly place the letter bar where you want it. Also getting a ‘new’ therapist match is far harder than talk space makes it out to be. Completly dissatified with how their searches are conducted.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I had to wait days for a response to my messages and weeks to schedule sessions. It’s pretty clear that the providers are overwhelmed and have way too many clients. I felt like a number instead of a person.

Talkspace, please consider limiting the amount of clients your providers can have at one time. This was a very poor experience. I’m going back to an in-person therapist.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up and could not even use the features paid for since the therapists are so overworked. My complimentary live video session will never be used because my therapist (and others I’ve tried) have zero openings for multiple weeks.

Not nice to do to people seeking help. Avoid avoid avoid.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up for a month at $250, took the test, and it connected me to a counselor. She took 3 days to respond (all the while I’d been paying). So, I switched to another counselor. She also took 3 days to respond. I told her it was unprofessional to take so long to respond to a patient mentally unstable at the time. She then refused to treat me, saying I needed in-person therapy. Ok.....

I emailed TalkSpace to get my money back.. silence. No response. 

Stay away!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I’m not positive this isn’t a scam— I haven’t been able to get responses from anyone on this app. The therapist never contacted me, or responded when I contacted her— and customer support hasn’t gotten back with me either.

1,You would think that since they are dealing with your mental health that they would respond in a timely manner but no. Neither my therapist nor the customer service team got back to me for five days. It wasn’t until I reached out to their customer support via Twitter that I got a reply. I needed therapist to talk to immediately and I never got to talk to someone at all. Don’t waste your money on this.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Sending and receiving texts is no way to get therapy. The ‘therapist’ I got felt as engaged as any customer service worker for a big tech company. 

Also, you’d think that a person of science could string a sentence together without multiple spelling errors, wouldn’t you? That might seem like a small matter, but for me, it really undercuts the qualifications of this so-called professional. I feel like I’m placing my trust (and my life) in the hands of a middling, though well meaning school girl.

This service isn’t exactly cheap, and swapping out therapists puts you back at square one, and with no better odds of getting someone better.

What a waste of time and money.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

I waited a whole day and at 9:30PM she tells me there’s a glitch in the system and she can’t even have me as a client. But then no one works weekend. So then you make me wait until Monday to talk to anyone???? I am done. I have more anxiety than when I STARTED. Idiots.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,This app was seriously disappointing but not because of the therapy treatments. I’ve had an account since may which I’ve tried cancelling several times but they would not let me. I tried contacting the help team over and over again and they STILL haven’t canceled it. I ended up replacing my card so they couldn’t charge me anymore. Be careful,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Easy to sign up. They take you’re credit card info right away. Took awhile to get set up and started with therapy. We had several issues arise that were unresolved.  Customer service was very slow to respond. I cancelled the subscription and only received a portion of the fee as a refund. Extremely disappointed with this app. It had good reviews but I would not recommend it at all.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,The concept is really cool but when it comes down to it you’re paying some really good money to speak to somebody and you’re not getting a response I feel like if you really think you need therapy it’s probably best that you go in person because you get the time and attention you need,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,A terrible scam!! They want you to pay even if you don’t talk to a therapist! The therapist they gave me cancelled every session I tried to book and then they tried to charge me for more time so I can book another session and wouldn’t give me another therapist even though he would not talk to me!

1,"I do not write reviews, however I needed to make an exception here. This service is dangerous if you expect mental health support and care. 

• Slow responses
• Very few actual psychologists, and if you can find one, no availability.
• I would encourage anyone who needs to speak to someone find any other resource and to stay safe and healthy

In the end fancy Michael Phelps marketing is far from a way to care for patients needing and expecting support. 

When it’s a blurred line between being a customer and patient it is very concerning.

Really want a refund but as for therapy you might as well go to a canyon and throw money into it and scream your problems into the void. Completely terrible app and I honestly feel like they stole $260 from me",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"They gave me a promotion to pay less for first time and they ended up charging me in full, I emailed and a few weeks later they responded saying “we’re sorry...” but didn’t solve any problem or mentioning it also they didn’t refund me the extra charges.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I was hoping this to have more then one insurance provider they take but in fact it’s only one premara of blue cross so I have to delete and uninstall because I can’t afford there prices being disabled! If they can add more insurance providers I bet this app can be more successful for people who want to do therapy on there own time in the luxury of their own home or when there on the go!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Therapists send you ONE message (often just a single sentence) once or twice a day. You do NOT have 24/7 access to anything or anyone except your own chat room. One of the therapists I talked to even said “Talkspace therapy is very slow and expensive.” I couldn’t agree more. I could have gotten the same quantity and quality of responses from people on Reddit for free. 
Don’t waste your time.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I wanted to give this a shot since I didn’t want to do Zoom therapy sessions, but it’s just not good. I didn’t feel like the “providers” (therapists) I spoke to really grasped what I was saying, it as more “I’m sorry you feel that way” and shoo’ing me on my way. It’s cheaper than regular therapy but I don’t think it’s worth it.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Downloaded this app Wednesday and messaged back & forth with the matching agent when I had time. Sent my last message Wednesday around 6. Today is Friday and I still haven’t received a message back so I’m deleting the app. Kinda worries me because you have people seeking help and no one taking to them. Not one of my triggers but it could be for someone else.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I spent a large amount of money and was assigned a therapist. She said she had already quit talkspace but they kept sending her clients.  Then contacted me several times a day when they wanted my money.  Once they had my money, they did not do anything to connect me to a new therapist.  I hope that I will receive a refund but I do not feel hopeful.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The customer service team says no to everything... this app is meant to help you but it’s really all about taking your money. The one star is purely for the lovely person I’m seeking counsel from, otherwise this is too expensive for overall value offered.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,A great service in theory but not going to be the right fit for everyone. Unfortunately a service like this will be held to a higher standard because of the service they provide. Just like I wouldn’t recommend a hospital that takes over a week to see an ER patient I cannot recommend this service.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"We are a couple. Their couples function is unclear and confusing. We are international clients. We've been trying to find a therapist over a week who is legally allowed to help us. Talkspace's matching bot has no idea who's licensed to practice internationally, so it keeps matching us with therapists who cannot help us, and wasting everyone's time. No customer service line. Incredibly frustrating.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Maybe my expectations were to high. I started this process on Sunday night. Took 4 hours to match me with a therapist. Started the intake process this am at 0:930. Was first unable to get acknowledgment that text was received. Over an hour later I got a text I would hear from her by 8 pm tonight. I was really hoping this could work for me.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,It seems that my first therapist didn’t know what to say to me. Awkward pauses during our video session and recommended I Google tools vs talking me through them. Switched therapists and not receiving a response in 5 days is extremely disappointing. I had multiple video sessions that went to waste. Def won’t continue.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Starting with the on boarding loop that it sends you on every time you try to change a setting, and ending with the fact that I wasn’t able to get a session and my provider get paid for the last 2 weeks, even though my insurance says I’m covered... This app is an encyclopedia of bugs.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The lowest cost on this app is $65 per week. I do not know of anyone without insurance, with or without unemployment would afford this. Why is this being advertised so heavily as an affordable / accessible way to access therapy? 

Other apps indicate if there are purchase required fo use the app on the App Store and there is no such a warning on this app. 

I am so lost.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I waited 9 hours to be given the quiz to match you to a therapist. I had a meltdown and felt like it was time to fix me and get back on track. And for what? These ppl seem to lack any sense of urgency. Mental health needs to be taken more seriously by developers. Our lives are in your hands. I assume customer support won’t respond so I’m reporting the charge as fraud.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"Nice concept, however they were always out, too expensive for the little conversations we do have. This is just an easy way to get money tbh I can talk to a wall and would be the same thing pretty much tell you what you want to hear...",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"The app does not have a way to show billing, insurance discount, etc. When I opened a ticket to ask for that information from customer service, I never got any reply (I gave up after waiting 2 weeks).",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,This is so impersonal.  The way it works is so weird.  I don’t want to drag things out throughout days and weeks.   Just set up a slot once a week and hash things out.  This format would take 100x longer than just setting aside an hour.   This platform is not for me and I doubt it’s for you but good luck all.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"They’ve charged me my copay for services, my account says I have a session credit, yet the app wants me to pay another $65 to schedule anything on top of what they’ve already charged and took from me and my insurance. Good luck getting tech support. It’s been over a week, two having the app and no one has yet to even acknowledge my issue. Stay away!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"The only way to contact customer support is by creating an in-app ticket. I created one in September and followed up twice to no response. They sent out a mass email on Monday saying to follow up if my ticket still hadn’t been resolved, which I did. Guess what—no response!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Leticia messaged me back only once out of 4 days i’ve been messaging her. This whole thing is a scam and is $360 for 4 weeks definitely not worth it. I get more comforts listening to podcasts then talking to these lazy “therapist” they only seem to care about getting money in their pocket
I regret so much trying this 4 week thing",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Signed up my teenage daughter to get help during the pandemic. Therapist took up to 24 hours to reply via text and didn’t at all connect with her. Kids need a way quicker reply time. By the time we figured out it wasn’t working and she wasn’t using it we had been charged $455.  Joke.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Find yourself a therapist locally. The therapists who you are matched with are often out of state and will drop you if they feel like it. Customer support was no help and has yet to answer any of my requests since coincidentally this sudden change happened the day after my subscription renewed. Good luck getting any help.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The app isn’t intuitive. Plus, people with anxiety don’t need their therapy to shut down because they can’t find a button they don’t know exists in their comment feed. I dropped out of treatment with a counselor I loved,who was helping me because of a dumb glitchy difficult app.  It should be easier.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Plain and simple, do not waste your money on this service. The customer service is non existent. You will not get a response if you reach out to customer service with any issues. My first “therapist” never responded to my initial message. For people struggling with mental health issues, this app will only make it worse.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,Your password requirement alone shows me you actually don’t want to help. When someone is searching for an app to get therapy the hang up should not be choosing a password. I don’t know why I even tried.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I joined Talkspac for couples counseling. This is the only thing I selected when asked why I was seeking therapy. I was matched with a couple of therapists and A) none of them had availability for video sessions and B) when I started a chat with one, she said she doesn’t do couples therapy. Really turned me off an already difficult process.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Customer service is terrible. Nobody ever responded to my question. The therapist I tried to talk to was locked out of her own account for a few weeks and I never got the time made up to me. For such an expensive service I would have expected at least a reply from customer service.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Unfortunately, this app is advertised for “everyone” but in reality is quite expensive for services so it’s really not for everyone. If you have money, great this app may be helpful. If you don’t, then I wouldn’t waste your time downloading. I was so excited when I first heard about, but was sorely disappointed.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"If you’re a person with limited means then this app is not for you. $300 month is attracting a certain clientele and, going off that price point, it’s not anyone with any true issues. So, I’d you’re a rich and (primarily) White person with unlimited means and no real problems, then this app is for you Becky, Karen, Paul, and Brett.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The “accredited” therapist I chose asked absolutely ridiculous follow up questions which had literally nothing to do with anything I had originally contacted them about.  

You can tell they are copy and pasting a templated response to as many people as possible and are taking zero time to understand your actual concerns. 

Absolute waste of time, go see a real therapist if you are looking for quality!

 I knew this was too good to be true! 

Shame on you, TalkSpace, for taking advantage of those needing additional guidance during such stressful times as these.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I spent a lot of money when I bought a large package and then got a counselor that wasn’t working for me. I submitted my concerns in a requested update by Talkspace. No response. And then to change counselors, it isn’t an easy process. I pay for counseling. I should be able to change counselor if I so choose with a simple request.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app seems useful if you have “normal” mental health issues to deal with (anxiety, depression, etc.) but I tried 3 different therapists and who all claimed to specialize in chronic pain and none were at all prepared. I’m pretty bummed that I spent upwards of $200 just to strike out three times. On the upside, it is pretty easy to switch providers.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Signed up for Talkspace 2 weeks ago. Dropped the first counselor for not responding for over a week, new one gave an intro message, but no response after. Definitely not worth the price, and I decided to save money by paying for 6 months. Feeling scammed and hopeless, which surprisingly, is bad for mental health, especially in a crisis.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Five emails to customer support and not one reply other than auto reply or robot reply. On the day I signed up for video plan I could not get a video appointment for over three weeks with the first couple therapists. I had to keep switching. 
Customer support is non-existent if you have an issue.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Every step of the way I encountered problems. After days of trying to sign up I got an error message saying there was a problem signing up after I chose my provider. Contacted customer service with a detailed explanation of my issues and screenshots. They responded with “What can I help you with?” 🤦🏼‍♀️,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Format is not great. I cancelled my account a month in, and they still charged me twice since then. There is no customer support phone number, only email. They do not get back to you with any sort of speed and now I’ve spent over $500 for two months I did not use.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Awful. No customer support. They are very misleading with the services they provide & they are not transparent with the cost. I tried many times to connect with customer service and no luck. I hope no one else who is looking for guidance has to go through the same experience.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up and was excited to try talkspace. Spent 2 hours signing up, taking quizzes and watching intro videos. Spent 1 hour writing my intro message to my therapist. No response. Requested a new therapist after several days... silence. Ended up cancelling and getting a refund. Disappointed, and this site needs lots of work!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I have been signed up for weeks now and still have not been able to get a therapist who can schedule any visits or respond regularly. This is a scam for 600 dollars, they do not care about you or apparently have the resources to take you on as a client. Look elsewhere.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I
This app and associated website are terrible to try and work through. They paid cash for those four star! You will be charged the minute you put in your details... even if you never find a therapist. And you will have to contest the charges to get a refund :) yup... total scammers!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The consultant is replying like an automated bot, she will work on marketing and telling you to buy their plans while you are writing what your issue is.

1,"These therapists are the new VA case managers, and I hate to see it. Glad I didn’t waste my hard earned money, just my employers, but this was a waste. Two months. Not a single response from multiple counselors. 

Give these therapists a reasonable amount of folks assigned to them, or give these folks back their money. Period.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I paid $160 as a discount for me first month. 1 month = 4 weeks. The “therapist” did not even begin any treatments with me until the 2nd week which would mean I am only getting 3 weeks rather then the 4 that I paid for. My therapist asked me when I will see a therapist. Service is an absolute joke!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,It took my selected therapist nearly 24 hours to inform me she won’t be able to help me based on my issues. They definitely are upfront about the price but don’t tell you that your therapist will respond sporadically. Maybe paying out of pocket instead of using insurance will cause better treatment.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I have tried several times to contact them and have not heard a word from them. I canceled my subscription before even using their services yet they still took the money out of my account and I can’t get in contact with anyone at all very unprofessional!!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I had high hopes but it literally was just me texting a “therapist” a few times a week and having her agree with what I was saying ... there was no unpacking.

2,"Therapist is great.

1,"I’ve been trying to get help from a therapist for days on this app and the only replies are from bots. I paid too much, $340 for one month, to not be able to speak to an actual person let alone the fact that I do need help. It adds insult to my already difficult situation",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The concept is great, but their therapists were not. If you want to waste time investing in talking to someone for weeks to have them insensitively dump you for no reason, then this might be for you. I told customer service ice my whole story, and they refunded me because they knew how wrong they were. This app is NOT the way to go.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Extremely disappointed that you can’t reschedule an appointment within 48 hours without being charged.  Especially when you have a kid home from school sick and have to get him tested for COVID.  You’d think there would be some flexibility to reschedule without being charged.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,The video call feature is a joke. The image freezes constantly. Their customer service response time is bad. Be aware that there is no way to freeze beyond 7 days or cancel your account on the app or website and customer service doesn’t reply timely.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I’ve been through two therapists with TalkSpace and I haven’t quite seen the value in this yet, unfortunately. From my experience, they’ve been unresponsive and the majority of what they’ve shared with me is general information. I really wish this would have worked.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

2,It’s great IF your therapist shows up! 2 no calls no shows in one month! Couldn’t leave a message saying hey I can’t be there or anything. Can’t get any immediate help when trying to contact customer support. I’m about to just quit!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,This service is sub par and highway robbery. I was billed for second month $396 in advance despite pressing end therapy numerous times. One month of service wasn’t even worth it. Therapist was unavailable and/inefficient. Don’t waste your time or money please. Terrible service. They care about monetary rewards not helping people or providing adequate service.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The app is buggy. My provider and I have both sitting in the app waiting to be connected but it never happened. They don’t have actually that many therapists available and for most part it seems Talkspace is therapists’ side job.

1,150$ for ten minutes texting with your therapist each day and if you’re not online at same time as they are then you missed the chance to talk to them Bc they’re “busy with other patients”. For $150 I expect much more than that,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Live sessions are great but I subscribed years ago when it wasn’t required and could reach out to my therapist via chat or text. Making live sessions required makes social phobiacs like myself not seek help. I reached out to customer service about this this and received no response.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"Even with my insurance, the cheapest rate is $45 a week. That’s ridiculous. The “free” session is just a bot that asks you a few questions then gives you the expensive plan options. Maybe it’s helpful if you’re rich, I don’t know. Poor people need therapy too, perhaps more.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,My therapist did not show up for my first session and did not offer a reason as to why it was missed. I requested my money back from customer service. I did not receive a complete refund.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,If you’re going to go out of pocket go somewhere else. The “therapists” could care less about you. I had such an awful experience after finally building up the courage to seek help. This company verified my theory that therapy is a giant scam. You’re better off suffering in silence than dealing with this app.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I may as well have flushed my money down the toilet. I got a very snarky response from the 1st therapist after pouring my heart out. The 2nd never engaged me. I have not been given a decent match in all my attempts. They kept matching me with people WHO ARE ON LEAVE. Save yourself the anxiety & headache. It just exacerbated my issues.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,I have been attempting to cancel subscription since October. It processes but then just gets put on hold. Support has been no support. Web site does not function properly and I would not advise using them if you don’t want to end up with more anxiety than you started with and a charge you can’t stop.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app is UTTERLY disappointing. 

Therapy is something that is SO hard to begin and takes a lot of courage to reach out to providers. So, when you pay almost $300 a month to have therapists text you back, it sounds exciting!

Except, it’s not. Because they don’t answer.

Waste of my time and money pouring my heart over text to SEVERAL providers who simply did not answer me within 48 hours. Such a shame this app has little to no accountability for the providers that customers are paying heftily for.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,I signed up for this app paid close to $400 and none of the therapist would respond to my session request of messages. I asked for my money back an no one from customer service will return my message either. Beyond frustrated with the services I received.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Therapy has the ability to help or harm. This is scientifically proven. 15 days in without a single acknowledgement of the vast information I provided , as requested.

That’s supposed to be basic human compassion known by many that don’t even possess a Master’s Degree.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Very deceiving in how they will charge your card. Took $750 out of my account and will not respond to my emails and phone calls. I’ll be reporting this app for fraud. This app was supposed to help my anxiety and it has only made it go through the roof. Thanks for nothing!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I haven’t been able to join for a live video session with my therapist since July 9 when we conducted our first and only video session. Talkspace has charged my FSA account 4 times for the $20 co-pay. Customer Support has not responded to my request for more than a week now. Very frustrating!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,It took a week to get a response and set up. Had to do the evaluation 3 times!  I turned off the service supposedly and still getting charged.  Their “customer service” takes 5-10 days to get back to you with 1 line of I’m sorry for your inconvenience.  It’s a nightmare.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Incredibly harmful considering what they require you to pay for an extensive fee before seeing the therapists they have to offer or specialties. 

Any reputable therapy provider would offer you detailed bios first. Check out other apps. 

The initial matching agent will drag on conversation before you have access to any options.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Sad to say I signed up and reached out and scheduled an appointment a week in advance with a therapist whom never responded nor confirmed the appointment and it was canceled by the system. Then I set up another appointment with another provider and exact same outcome. I gave up. This is quite sad and very unprofessional.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"Don’t do this unless you want short generic responses you could have read in a self help book sent to you twice a day. 

There is no quality control to the responses the therapists give and because you are not with them in person they can just ignore you. The “guaranteed response times” are basically optional.

The supposed algorithm to match you with someone who specializes in your condition doesn’t really seem to be working.

1,"No matter what I do, I can’t create an account with a password that doesn’t need to be set. The password requires are higher than encrypted vaults but hey- that makes sense, right? Either way, no password sticks. Resetting leads to an endless resetting/locked out flow. 

Super fun! Thanks everybody.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I guess this app helps for people who are older but in the App Store it says 12+ so why don’t people who are 12+ get any service I mean they gave us some numbers for Health line and stuff but what makes you think we can’t find that on the internet I just need someone to talk to and they won’t offer me help 🥱,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I think the idea of this app is great however, from my experience it falsely advertises communication with a therapist at least 5 days a week. That was not the case for me at all. I switched therapist a few times because I never got passed the initial conversation.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I got matched with a therapist that had no interest in helping me or replying to me. I tried to switch therapists and there was no one available and when I decided to go back to my original therapist she informs me she’s leaving the platform. Waste of time and money,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This app may be perfect for you, but for those who struggle with depression and mental illness this app is not a good option.

Basically, it entails texting between you and a provider. There are live sessions but they cost extra ON TOP of the subscription...

I tried it for over a month. Not great.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Completely ignored. I don’t know if it’s a problem with the app or with the therapist not responding but I will be seeking to get a refund. I hope that it helps some people but it is very expensive to get nothing out of it.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"It took an entire week to even get one response, and then the therapist ghosts you for days. If you are really in need of help, and don’t have hundreds of dollars to burn, do yourself a favor and stay away from Talkspace. Seriously disappointed.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"While I loved my therapist, the app was extremely hard to navigate and I was not able to schedule any sessions, and my therapist couldn’t either. I needed someone to talk to as soon as possible and this could not give it to me (support takes 24 hours to respond).",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I tried multiple passwords, all with 8 or more characters, an upper case, lowercase, numeric, and symbolic characters. It still kept saying my passwords were “weak” or “so-so” without telling me the criteria.

I just deleted the app. I’ll used betterhelp instead, this app blew it.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,The pricing is insane for what it offers and the time someone actually spends with you or answers back…. You’re better off going to see someone in person local.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"I understand they do not have a back and forth with you, but I was asked a question by my “therapist “ and then she just disappeared. Anyway will not be continuing with this service.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Do not use this app. They cancellation process is through the app, not Apple App Store. They will not allow cancellation after app issues and has not given me a refund. They also don’t provide an option to take away credit card information.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I paid for one month and feel like I get nothing. My therapist repeats herself like she doesn’t know what she already sent me. (Sends me the same pictures twice). Assigns “homework” which I like. But when I try to discuss things, it’s a brief, not helpful response. I’m disappointed I spent so much money on this to flop.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"If you subscribe, the only way to apply insurance is through a second subscription.

They don’t use standard IAP; you have to given them your card, so you’re not protected by Apple’s normal App Store protections.

In order to cancel subscriptions you need to click through seven different “please don’t unsubscribe” screens.

They use weasly language, instead of “your insurance isn’t supported” it’s “you get a limited time discount!”

I don’t recommend unless it’s your only option.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I cannot type messages in my room, only audio works. Not useful at all. The professionals might be good but the tech is absolutely not user friendly. Also service response was over 12 hours. Will be seeking a refund",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The site will take your money, promise follow up from qualified therapist and then leave you waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting. You will only get a timely response if you threaten to cancel your subscription.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I am on short term disability for major depression and signed up when I saw they accepted my insurance. Therapist didn’t seem to track and I think may have been a BOT. I feel more traumatized than before using it. Better off without it.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I was SO excited to try this. Unfortunately, I went through two therapist and neither one responded. Honestly a waste of time and money. In person therapy is expensive, but at least you’ll actually receive help.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"No response from first therapist, waited for two days and switched back to another therapist and didn’t got response. Contacted support to cancel my subscription, but no timely response from support either.. I don’t recommend this app.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"Cool concept but had a poor experience compared to conventional therapy in the past. Therapist was unorganized plus rarely available, and app charged monthly Vs per session. Also my platinum PPO insurance barley covered any of the costs.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I cancelled the service but have still been charged for a full month. I tried to reach out to customer service over a week ago and still no response,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"I love my therapist but this app has made it impossible to schedule and they have over charged me multiple times. When I try to reach out for help, no one ever gets back to me. Customer service is absolutely terrible.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"They ask you to fill out an intake form to share with your therapist, okay... that makes sense. 

The therapist finally responds with the same questions from the intake form and send you some links to articles on dealing with anxiety. That’s lame. 

You respond, but it will take at least another day to hear back from the therapist. 

What is this? It’s like playing chess by mail. What is the point of having a therapist that doesn’t set a time to chat with you and just sends lame articles. Avoid this app.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,gave google advice every time. one just told me to go to the doctor every time I said something and when I switched providers again the last one didn’t even respond. waste of money,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I really needed to start therapy, and they don’t have any providers available. It’s a joke. Is this even a service ? Don’t bother even trying to set it up. They can’t keep up with demand and just send you automated messages.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up for Talkspace to seek guidance for a struggling relationship. I was connected with a therapist, but she did not respond to my messages in a timely manner. I lost motivation to work with the app and decided to cancel. They didn’t offer a refund despite my obviously poor experience.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I was left on read and honestly wasn’t a priority. So from my experience it’s a scam. I’m getting a whole refund. I think I’m just gonna go back to talking to myself. At least I’m dependable and responsive.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Pick a different telehealth app. 

This one won’t tell you what will be covered by insurance, bill you without your insurance even getting claims, and not help you when you’re left with hundreds in medical bills.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"Tried two therapist, the first one basically said everything was my fault and the second one never responded to me. Very disappointed that I paid so much money for nothing. Would not recommend.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I experienced a Revolving door of therapists.  None of them responded in a timely manner. most of them are not remotely interested in their jobs The questions were a single line and sometimes even just a couple of words,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"If I could zero stars I would. The therapists show as “working” but don’t respond, don’t show up for live sessions, and support never writes back. I basically paid almost $400 to fill out some surveys and received zero help, assistance, or support.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"therapists didn’t respond, cancelled my video call appointments, and when i tried to get another therapist I was recommended some lady who specializes in issues i don’t have problems with! waste of money and time to get no therapy.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I would have better luck texting my exes for all the non-responsive therapists on this app. Either they are overbooking the therapists or their tracking tools are terrible because for 3 months, my therapists ghosted me till I switched.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"The idea if having someone there when you need them, I mean really need them is appealing. I didn't even think I would pay to be ignored and not have the option to immediately be refunded.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,The conversation is not live and very asynchronous. Some therapists barely reply to you! You don't feel heard at all. I hated my experience and it was a waste of $160 for a month!!! I hate this app. Way to make my mental health worse by scamming me out of my money.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,The Therapist sends live session invites and cannot get on using my iPad or iPhone. The software worked last week. Cannot get any online customer service. I am beginning to wonder if this company is a going concern.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Literally took weeks to even get an introduction video chat and scheduling was out two weeks. Double billed me & 3 minutes behind for appointment I waited for weeks to be canceled due to being 3 minutes late.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I tried to find a therapist, though I was matched with very few options, including a therapist that only provided pre-recorded and text therapy?  Huh?  Some of the providers did not seem highly qualified and not worth the money.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Watch out for Talkspace. All they’re interested in is taking your money. The providers or therapists are great but the company will always try to blame them for the companies problems. Customer beware on this one. It’s a darn shame they hooked Michael Phelps into this.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,To expensive. Use to be cheaper. I rather go pay $75 for someone here then pay that over $65 a week when I have low income which btw they got no option for when other apps do.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Seriously the biggest waste of time. I had a need and finally took a step for getting help.  eventually got a reply that ultimately made me feel like I was a huge burden to whoever the “therapist” was. Skip this app and move on. You won’t regret taking my advice.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I’m on Medicaid need help and we are in a pandemic, I was offered a discount but would still have to pay 35 to 65 a week? I’m not even working barely paying our bills and losing my mind and Medicaid won’t cover this? Ridiculous!!!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

I made four separate appointments. I was one minute late for the first one. Three minutes early for the second one. 15 minutes early for the third one. And the fourth one I was a half hour early. I paid $400For nothing but text message!

1,I paid for the premium service to include live sessions. It took weeks to get matched with someone who would actually provide service. There were no live sessions and each interaction seemed to be a struggle.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"This app and program is BS. It’s not even been three months and two of my “doctors” have left the Talkspace as a provider. What’s the point in using if you keep having to reacquaint yourself with someone?? 
Not helpful at all!",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,It’s bs. I need help but all the therapists keep cancelling. You have to answer a thousand questions to get anyone to tell you a time. A week out. If I could wait a week I wouldn’t be on an on call app. Deleting it,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"Will charge you twice in 2 weeks and reuse to refund it. Absolutely not worth it. If you do try it, partner with your new therapist and ditch the app, they will take your money for no reason, it’s insanely overpriced and they refuse to undo their asshatery.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

2,"I’ve been interested in using Talkspace for some time now. Finally, my moment came when receiving an email from my company about having 3 months free so I decided to take the plunge. I’ve seen therapists before but this would be the first I’ve done it through an app so I was extremely excited to see how I could get started. For starters, I don’t necessarily find the app to be user friendly. It isn’t the easiest to navigate if you want to figure out if you’ve scheduled any appointments or just want to poke around in settings. From there, the match coach isn’t much help. You’re given some options after taking a short assessment, but if you don’t find anyone you’d feel you can connect with, you can only see new matches two additional times before having to start the quiz over, Input all of your information all over again just to receive the same options as before. 

You can contact their CX team via the app which is great and after taking a loon I figured it would be a live chat but I shortly received an email notification stating I’d be contacted shortly. Not too sure why it would be set up as a chat interface if it isn’t that. I still haven’t received any information about any of the therapist I thought I scheduled (selected a therapist, date, time and all), no contact back from the matching coach, or from the CX team. Honestly, you’d probably be better off going to psychology today where there are better filters and just emailing a therapist yourself.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"Due to covid I was trying to do online therapy, but I have a particular disorder I need a therapist to have worked with before in order to help me. I was told it would be possible to find someone fit to me but that was not the case at all. The only specification I had was the person had to have worked with this disorder before, yet I was suggested what seemed like random people and none of them had worked with anything even close to what I was looking for. I was suggested a therapist that worked with male issues and I am a female, and one that worked with porn addiction which is no where even NEAR the other neurological disorder I have. When I asked if there was a way my marcher could recommend me more specific options she simply didn’t respond. I went through multiple pages of therapists and they got more and more random as I went on. The only person that could help me was my matches that had read my message and not responded for over 24 hours. I eventually asked again if there was a way she could help me refine the results and yet again she didn’t respond, the bare minimum she could have said was that it’s too specific for her to know. But radio silence from someone who is supposed to be a professional helping me is unacceptable. There is also no other way to find a therapist, and there is no way to switch even if they are not helping or responding at all. Eventually when I asked how to get a refund after her not responding to my past 2 messages asking for help she responded immediately but did not address anything from my 2 messages before that one. My experience was horrible and so frustrating because they obviously did not care about helping me find someone that actually fits my needs.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"I decided to get help with with some of my emotional issues. I was hoping to be able to just talk to a professional over the phone on my way home from work some days. This app is definitely not that. I didn’t really understand until I got into it but the cheapest plan they offer is $65 per week. This only includes two text messages a day from a therapist. So $260 a month to get 2 replies a day. There is also no guarantee that these replies are going to be at all helpful. I have heard maybe one piece of useful advice from a therapist on this app. I feel like I can pour my heart out to a therapist and then 4 days later(due to the therapist you choose only working a few days a week) I might get a message that says something vague like “what do you think makes you feel that way?” I don’t see how this app is helpful to anyone with a real issue with depression or that genuinely needs a person to talk to. The only way to get more interaction is to upgrade to their higher plans. Those can cost up to 400/ month. So then you basically get a few live video chats for a car payment. I  don’t know how expensive normal therapy is, however I feel I could pay anyone $400 per month and get more useful help than I have gotten from this app. I changed therapists because of some of the issues I have stated, and since I changed therapists on Friday I have gotten 1 message from her. She is apparently off on weekends, but here it is, 5pm on a Monday and still no sign of life that anyone is going to try and give me any kind of help. Save your money, all of this has stressed me out and made me even more anxious waiting on the possible chance someone will respond to any one of my questions.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Unprofessional from their doctors to their  matching agents and customer support.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Beware!  There seems to be no where to review talkspace besides the App Store,Otherwise I would not use this for him. The app is fine and works functionally. The therapist x 2 I have used have been great.  The talkspace service is awful. Customer service is awful and doesn’t reply to any messages or inquiries except for automated options.  I signed up and paid in advance for six months including one live session a week because it seemed very cost effective. The first month was great but then my therapist and I could never coordinate schedules for my live sessions. They appeared to be rolling over, so I wasn’t stressed.  After several months of only being able to coordinate a handful of live sessions, I decided I really needed to change therapists.  I reached out for advice from customer service on that and also whether my insurance would help cover some of the talkspace fees. Three messages to talk space and not a single reply.  I gave up trying and since I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings so I decided to put my therapy on pause and during that pause it appeared that my live sessions were on hold with it. The app actually show that I had six live sessions that expired after my pause ended. Everything came off pause in November, I had one life session and then the rest disappeared and even though I am paid in full through the middle of January,  it appears that I have no live sessions. Customer service will not reply to my inquiries. Basically I’ve spent nearly $1900 for a handful of text messages back-and-forth to a therapist and for live 30 minute sessions. It’s an incredible waste of money and frustrating to not have anyone in customer service communicate because everything is completely online through chat support. Well this is a great concept its functionality is limited and I suspect they grew too fast to really provide any sort of good service. I plan to move forward through my credit card company to see what can be done and if not seek legal action.  Beware. And certainly don’t pay them for more than a month at a time",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"The concept of online therapy sounds great and convenient, but it’s not very personable.
This app might be good for someone working through a temporary issue, but for anyone with chronic mental health issues I’d advise you steer clear. 
The process to match up with a therapist was easy to navigate and user friendly, however, after getting matched up with a therapist it was like they weren’t even reading what I was writing to them. They’d asked if I had been in therapy before after I had already stated that. Then they asked what brought me to talk space after I had literally just finished explaining myself. After that I was directed to the talkspace bookshelf and wasn’t really sure where to go from there. I was lucky to get a sentence or two a day from my therapist in response to paragraphs. I was also supposed to get a complimentary video chat that was never initiated. My therapist stopped checking in with me and I considered getting another,  but I figured it was better to cancel before the month was up before losing out on more money. With the pandemic going on I figured this was the only way to get counseling, but I’d rather wait until things open back up since this was more expensive and less convenient than actual in person therapy. 
If you just wanted someone to talk to through a temporary issue, go for it, but if you have severe depression, anxiety, or addiction, save your money. There’s peer counseling apps and sites that are much more helpful than this service.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

2,"I used Talkspace for almost two years, but quit the platform when my therapist wouldn’t stop harassing me when I tried to talk to her about my racial identity. When I asked, she told me she was qualified to talk about racial issues. But when I first raised the issue, her instant response was “All lives matter,” and “I am not going to talk about politics.” In the wake of the worldwide protests against racism, she tried to walk it back and said that she only said those things because she did not want me to take on too much for other people. She also said, “I am not racist.”  And, she said that I needed to apologize to her, because how dare I attack her and make all these assumptions about her. If this is not the textbook example of weaponizing white privilege, I do not know what is. I tried to go back to the platform to select a therapist that could work with me on racial issues, but there is no option for that. At the same time, Talkspace has touted itself on its Instagram and website as being aware and committed to helping BIPOC with issues related to race in America. (Which it only did in the wake of George Floyd’s death.)

I believe this is an important issue to raise because Talkspace is a mental health service, and mental health issues often affect BIPOC in unexamined ways. Further, I am a healthcare attorney, and I am acutely aware that BIPOC remain underserved in the area of mental health. 

All in all, I would not trust Talkspace to provide BIPOC the same level of care it provides its white clients.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I don’t usually review apps, but I have to call this out to protect others. I’m not rich. Therapy is $$$. So I did one month of this talkspace during a crisis period in my life. I give two stars for my actual therapist who has nothing to do with the app itself. I wanted to cancel after a month and customer service took two weeks to respond, making me freak out that they’d charge me $400 or so, I had to freeze my credit card and pause my subscription to avoid it. Finally they reply offering me a discount, and I accepted that offer. But they charged my credit card actually MORE than the subscription- negating my discount and then some. I’m sure they’ll resolve it in two weeks but it’s already in my card statement, the damage is done.

Talkspace will repeatedly lure you into giving them your money and then not giving you value. I switched to a different plan mid-month, assuming that since I paid for a month in full already, the new, cheaper plan would take effect after the end of the current cycle. Nope. My therapist was like ‘well I’ll talk to you in a week!’ I was shocked. Customer service will of course take two weeks to reply like last time, so by then my plan will be expired anyway, making the whole exercise of contacting them pointless. I’m so so mad. They just take advantage of people!

Update: the second time they robbed me, they are also taking away time I paid them for therapy. I write to support every day for five days, no reply. They have added so much stress to my life and cut off my connection to my therapist. I paid for the time till September 13 yet after that I wanted to b downgraded my plan - they downgraded it right away last Friday. And I’ve lost two weeks of $$ I paid. And the session I had planned tomorrow with my therapist is apparently not happening. I do not like talkspace.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"I attempted to use this app because it was gifted to me. The entire intake process is strange and impersonal with a bot sending messages like “from everything we discussed, here are some therapists that would work for you” when I hadn’t entered any personal information. After being shown a few options you select a therapist. The first therapist I chose sent messages that were nearly illegible because of typos. I don’t care about occasional misspellings, but every other sentence she wrote had words that were clearly not meant to be in them and maybe autocorrect making it hard to understand what she was attempting to say. After spending a half hour looking through more therapists and choosing another person, I sent the new therapist information about what I was trying to get help with and I was met with a response that said that her responses will be similar to the last therapist I spoke to and that I should expect typos and if that’s not what I want I should go look for someone else. How is this acceptable? It only takes a moment to look back and make sure that your autocorrect isn’t completely changing the meaning of a sentence. How are you supposed to get help from someone who can’t communicate legibly? I’ve WASTED hours of my time now on this app with no results. I was gifted this by my sister and know I will not continue to waste my time on this for what it is. I contacted customer service to ask that my sister be refunded and was told that Talkspace cannot refund gift cards “at this time.” Why?

1,"It would be zero stars if that were an option. My 18 year old step-daughter was going through anxiety a few days before starting Freshman year away to college, add to the fact that she had a cold and afraid it was COVID, she had mini meltdown. I asked her if she heard about these Therapy apps and asked if she thought she could benefit from talking to someone. She looked a few up and found Talkspace. She said it cost $69 a week but there was a savings promotion too. I told her, try it for a week. I checked my CC account the next day and Talkspace charged me $643. I flipped out. This poor kid now had to deal with the stress of an irate parent. She used the in-app messaging system to cancel the service, an auto response received about being backed up and that they should answer shortly. Two days go by, still no responses. I use the number for the merchant listed on my credit card. Phone wasn’t going through at all or cutting off completely, so I dispute the charge. The CC company gives me an adjustment in August and now September, the charge has reappeared on my account. Talkspace claims my step-daughter agreed to Terms and Conditions. Are you kidding me? I just clicked the “Get Help With This App” through the Apple App Store and it directs me to a site with a 404 error. This is B.S. and I will not let this stand. They failed to respond to any messages to cancel the service. It’s been one month and my step-daughter hasn’t used it at all. What did that $643 buy me???

1,"I’ve done therapy I’m the past and I found the first therapist I tried here to be decent and responsive except for a major issue I had with her so I had to switch. The next therapist saw my first message, sent me a test (Zanarini??? For borderline personality disorder??? I’ve already explained my dx to her which is PTSD only, as I have been treated with a psychiatrist for years) or at least I think that was her sending it. She never responded EVER as in never sent a text at any point. So I switch again after a few days and the next one has been my “therapist” for 8 days now and not once has contacted me even after I asked to get started and have waited 4+ days and still no response. So so far I haven’t had therapy for 2 WEEKS (but did for the first) and I have requested a refund for the last three weeks of the month because I did not get what I paid for on any level. I feel like even the first one didn’t take me seriously. I had been out of therapy for 2 years and was excited to get to work and now honestly I feel set back especially after how poorly the one time I talked about a recent traumatic event went. If you have PTSD or trauma you’re trying to deal with, do not try this service ever and mean it. That goes for other serious mental issues like psychosis or bipolar because this place is not able to help you. If this is standard experience I can’t imagine recommending this to anyone dealing with any problem at all. But most definitely, don’t even try it if you have severe issues.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I had high hopes for this app , do yourself a favor save your money and go to real therapy sessions. I’m aware that they have placed impossible expectations and pressure on their therapists , that this is just a side hustle with too many rules and a lot of them are overbooked . You’ll get 2-3 replies a day,  all of them using a limited amount of words because talkspace has some rule about that . I know for a fact that my therapist hasn’t been reading what I have been writing even though I have tried to be brief out of consideration. My therapist have asked me questions that I just answered in the previous text smh , happened twice in one day and that is when I decided that I was done with this . Having used this app left me feeling sad and disappointed at the fact that they capitalize on something as serious as mental health , everyone is losing on this game except for talkspace

Update : this service is terrible, the therapist just ask a bunch of questions and doesn’t give you any insight or tips to improve the situation . I finished the twelve weeks and the therapist just mentioned that my paid sessions were almost up , asked me two more questions , I replied and after that nothing else was said . The therapist didn’t even read the message .... you would think that if my time was almost up , there would be some type of closure /final suggestion to improve what led me to seek therapy . You are just going to be left in the air even though the therapist knows that your time in almost up and he/she needs to wrap it off 

I guess they want you to pay more to get a final insight / closure to your therapy smh",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

2,"So I joined about 2 weeks ago and so far I wish I hadn’t because I haven’t had much in terms of therapy. They rarely reply and when they do it’s not much help. Not to mention that not every therapist has the same certification some are social workers/counselors I’m not sure if they mean schoolers or AA counselors. Honestly charging $200 a month for a couple of emails is crazy.
The first therapist I was matched to was nice but only replied to me once a day. Even though they says you get 2-3 replies. When he replied to me the replies felt kind of like self help quotes and he would say what I told him back to me. For example, if I said “I want help establish boundaries with my family because they do this, this, and this,” his reply would be something like “your feelings are valid and it’s important to establish boundaries”. I wasn’t sure if that was normal like in the beginning of therapy so I stuck it out for a week. 
Once a week passed I decided to switch therapist so I took matching quiz again, the people that were recommended were all social workers and didn’t seem to match any of the focuses i had selected. So I took the quiz again and got matched to more social workers that didn’t match any of my focus. I did it again and the same thing happened so I asked to speak with an agent. She tried to match me to some people but the people available weren’t much better, that’s when the agent explained that due to COVID they have been under staffed so at the moment they won’t be able match me correctly. I get that they are understaffed but they’re offering a service that’s pricy so they should make sure to have enough therapist available. I didn’t say this to the agent though because it’s not her fault it’s really talkspace’s fault. I eventually got matched to someone. 
Once I got my other therapist I was excited and asked her a couple questions. She took a day to reply to me and when I replied to her she never got back to me. I’m still waiting to hear from her. The first therapist at least got back to me by the end of the day but she takes one to two days to reply.

Update: I just switched again and my current therapist is much better and she does reply like 2-3 times per day.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"I tried TalkSpace after leaving an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship. I had an in-person therapist who helped wonders, but I just couldn’t afford it after my money ran out. I was hoping for an affordable option that could help when the panic attacks hit, and this sounded promising. I was able to choose a woman who specialized in abusive relationships and trauma and was excited at the thought of getting some sort of healing. Did I expect this to be just as great as my in-person therapist? Absolutely not. But I was definitely hoping to continue something, at least, to keep me going. 

I wasn’t able to get her schedule until I chose her and couldn’t go back. That was quite a bummer considering she was only available one day a week for two hours. And her responses to my texts? “You can do this... Keep going... How does that make you feel?... I know this can be hard, but you’re strong...” It felt like I was scrolling Pinterest quotes for an insane price. She would text me back only once and when I would respond quickly, I wouldn’t hear back until the next week. I didn’t even get her for those two hours. I’m past that problem, now my anxiety-ridden brain is onto something else since a week has gone by. She didn’t offer calls or video chats either.

I understand Talk Space is most likely a side gig for therapists who work full-time in an office, but holy cow. I felt worse coming out of it than going in. Lost my money, lost my time, lost my dignity crying over a phone waiting for a text back to make me feel better. Sound like a familiar scenario?

I try not to blame the therapist for a poor set up, but also, why offer potential life-saving services at two hours a week if they can’t be maintained? Maybe I got the short end of the stick. I only had a month to test it and then I had to pay full price. There was an option to try another therapist, but maybe there should be an option to not have to pay that entire price until you find someone you can connect with? When I had insurance, my EAP offered six free sessions per issue until I found the right person. And when I found her, I stuck with her until my money ran out. I don’t know, I’d like to think people would pay for it and stick with it if it meant saving themselves. 

Maybe offer tiers in pricing depending on what the therapist offers? If they only offer texting, of they offer calls, video calls, two or all three? I felt cheated to be expected to pay so much money for one text a week that never went anywhere. I haven’t checked TalkSpace lately, so I’m not sure if this part has changed. But that would probably make me want to check it out again with a new therapist that offered more than an inspirational quote they stole from a poster hanging in my boss’ office.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Who can seriously afford this?!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I am a plan administrator, and made an effort to review the process for setting up an account and ensuring all went smoothly. 

First, the website directs you through multiple steps including getting your payment option for what I realized was not an agreed upon term for the customer. You haven’t chosen a counsellor, you’ve just entered in your information, including payment. Doesn’t feel good. 

Then I only received 2 options for counselors, one was not appropriate to my selected goals so I chose the other. It didn’t feel good. 

Then I tried to set a tome to meet this therapist, there were only 2 options, 10 minutes or 45 (not even the standard counseling session, considering they’re certainly charging $120 per week which which you could pay and see a counsellor in person for 55 minutes to an hour.) 

I chose 10 minutes and lo and behold this counsellor doesn’t even have calendar space and I get a message that there’s no availability for 3 weeks. Well, so I’ll be charged $120 a week to “text” with thsi person who I haven’t even spoken to or know will be a good fit, while I wait to have 10 minutes... that’s absolutely insane. 

This service either can’t keep up with demand or is just plain awful but even customer service to find reassignment was a huge pain. I still have no reassignments of options and feel far more stressed out than when this process began. I can’t recommend this to anyone seeking help. You’re better off cold calling counselors in your city than this mess.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"To start this off I really never leave reviews for anything unless I feel like it’s really a major issue that people beware of - It’s actually irresponsible this app is allowed to operate. Please avoid using this app if you need reliable help and here is why:

I’ve done in person therapy pre-pandemic so I know what it’s supposed to be like. Because of the pandemic I decided to give virtual therapy a try with Talkspace. The first issue is there were slim picking for providers - which is strange to me since it’s a virtual service it’s not like the provider has to be in your city, but this is minor. When I did finally land on a provider it was fine at first but then he very quickly became unreliable - which was the second issue. Some people opt to message throughout the week - I opt for the 60 minute session once a week. The provider was egregiously late on more than one occasion or would simply cancel at the last minute - which they charge you for anyways even if the cancellation is on the provider end. 

The third issue is there often seems to be glitches with the app itself or providers are not adequately trained in the interface or with the technology. There were several instances where I wanted to book another session with the provider and he simply wasn’t doing the after session wrap-up on his end to allow the app to provider another available session to book. I had to remind him of this several times until I eventually got tired of having to do this. There were several weeks where I would have booked sessions where I simply wasn’t able to do it was a very haphazard schedule. The fourth issue here is you are completely at the mercy of the providers schedule. They can either forget to allow you to book, or cancel a session at will with no consequences. In regular therapy this could also be an issue but when I had an in person therapist they almost never cancelled and were much more cognizant of my time and keeping a regular treatment schedule.

Once I realized this was actually mentally exhausting me I decided to switch providers to see if that would alleviate. The second provider was a no-show on the intro session. So clearly Talkspace isn’t really vetting providers well and definitely aren’t monitoring their service in any meaningful way. Which brings me to the final issue - there is no customer service number. Big red flag for any service. You cannot call and speak to a representation you have to submit a ticket with your complaint and wait for a response. This could take anywhere from a week to a month or more and from my experience it’s more on the longer side. I did it once and realized it was futile. 

In conclusion this app is terrible for your mental health actually. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone seeking reliable mental help especially if you’re desperate it would most likely push you over the edge. Not sure how the psych board lets this kind of malpractice fly - mental health is a serious thing.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,That was not effective for me,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"This was a pretty miserable experience. My therapist sent me one text a day, asking for clarification on things I went into extreme detail about. Then she wouldn’t do anything with the extra information I gave her. She just moved on. I expressed frustration, but she made it seem like it was my fault, so I dropped it.

About two weeks I asked her to hold me accountable with some goals. I figure if she’s only gonna text me once, she can at least check to make sure I’m doing what I want to be doing, but she didn’t. She didn’t check on me for a week. And I really needed help during that week. What could have been a small conversation turned into me staying inside for 4 days.

This past week (our final week together), we’ve mostly been trying to schedule a video call because she has a different schedule than what’s on Talkspace and many in person clients who are clearly the priority. However, we weren’t able to figure it out and now I won’t get to use it. 

Additionally she never talked about making a plan based on what I told her. We never went over any assessments. (Besides her literally reading the results. I know what the answers say I wrote them.) Nor did we talk about the Talkspace program itself. So it looks like there are a lot of really cool features that I missed out on. 

It says you guys use licensed therapists but if you asked me I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between this program and a kind middle schooler with too much time on their hands.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"I’ve never left a review for an app/service before, but I felt compelled to do so with TalkSpace because I fear that they are taking advantage of people’s mental health issues, especially amidst everything going on with COVID. 

I love the idea of Talkspace and think it could have been a perfect tool for me. Unfortunately, my first two providers took days to reply to my simple messages, and when they did finally reply, I was usually given an unhelpful and generic sentence or two. My first provider asked me what had and hadn’t worked in the past for me in therapy, and I said I didn’t care for worksheets. So she sent me…worksheets, ones that I could have easily found on the Internet on my own. And my second provider took so long to respond to messages that TalkSpace offered me additional free weeks of service. Seeing as the app has an immediate option to offer this kind of thing, I’m guessing they’re used to people complaining about providers taking so long. 

After my first provider abruptly left TalkSpace and my second provider stopped responding altogether, I found someone who I actually connected with. She said she was training to become a full-time employee of TalkSpace and I was excited to have more time with her. What I didn't know was that if I wanted to have that time with her beyond a quick message here and there, I had to pay $65 for a 30-minute video session on top of the monthly fee I already pay. Needless to say, I wasn’t going to do that. I'm not paying $200+ a month to get a one-sentence message every other day, and I'm certainly not going to pay more for a video session knowing that the quality of service will likely be lacking (if the rest of TalkSpace is any indication). 

I find it noble that TalkSpace wants to make therapy more accessible to more people, but I'm starting to wonder how much of that is just a facade to get people to cough up more money for a lackluster service. If you’re considering using TalkSpace, please know what you’re paying for. It is not traditional therapy, but rather a sporadic message here or there, with some generic worksheets tacked on. If you’re willing to pay for the video sessions, your experience may be better than mine. But this isn’t how you share therapy with the masses.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up for Talkspace in the beginning of January thinking Telehealth might be my best option. I quickly realized its not for me. I paid for the 6 month service to save money. If I signed up for a bulk of months, I saved like 30%. The total cost for 24/7 chat thread, 4 video chats a month and unlimited voicemail services for 6 months was $1896. 

They set you up with a matching agent to find out what kind of provider you're looking for. Great. 

The first provider I matched with ignored me for days and wouldn't confirm any of the video chat appointments I scheduled (and paid for with my package) which ultimately led to them being canceled at the last minute. I decided she didn't work for what I needed so the matching agent started to match me with other therapists. 

She matched me with therapists that had no available appointments, dealt with mainly pediatric patients, or their language was Spanish which I don't speak. It was added stress when I was looking to speak to someone about the stress I already had. I grew frustrated. 

The next provider I thought I successfully matched with was super attentive, but was really reluctant to video chat with me even though it was a service I paid for. Every time I scheduled a video chat, she asked me if it was ""really necessary"" or if I would prefer a phone call instead. When I finally got her to video chat with me, I was left with a frozen screen on her side showing a wall and the tippy top of her forehead for the entire 45 minutes. The things she talked during the video chat where strange and not ""therapist-y"" at all. She started to talk about HER prolems. She was almost childish in the way she spoke. I didn't feel like she was taking me seriously and there was something... off... about her speech. I ended the video chat feeling anxious, blamed and ridiculous. Like I offered her more advice than she offered me. I threw her name into a simple google search and found out she has severe mental disabilities. Im not even entirely sure she's qualified for a therapist position because I could find very little on her education experiences. I only found articles from when her and her family were interviewed about her disabilities. 

I decided I didn't want to waste any more time searching for a therapist with this service who has provided me with nothing but more stress and aggravation. So I canceled my subscription and asked for a refund. They canceled my membership and immediately told me they were sending me a refund for $1882. It was $14 less than I paid but I figured that was fine since that's about what I would pay for the janky services I received.

A week went by and I checked my account to make sure the refund went through. Thats when I found out that it did, but they also charged me again. $276 came out of my account and I emailed to ask why. Their website provides NO PHONE NUMBER to contact an actual human. A few days went by with no response so I emailed AGAIN.... no response. 

Just this weekend I get an email saying ""Thank you for your purchase."" They charged me an ADDITIONAL $396 and told me my next payment will be taken on March 14th. 

So during this past month when I have had NO SUBSCRIPTION with their service, they have charged me $672 total. 

I have emailed multiple times with no response. I signed on to my Talkspace page and it clearly states I have no subscription and that I canceled on January 19th. I tried to remove my CC information they have stored and it wouldn't let me. I tried to enter false cc information thinking it wouldn't go through the next time they tried to charge me and they would then, of course, try and contact me.... but it wouldn't let me do that either. 

I put my FBI cap on. Since there's no phone number anywhere on their website, I googled their physical address. Then I googled the phone number for that address. I called it and it was an automated Talkspace voicemail machine. I left a message and still no response. 

Thats when I decided to make this post. I tried to be an adult about this, but lately companies only seem to respond when they're publicly bashed on the internet. 

Im not normally a Karen, but Im prepared to go full Karen over the $672 Talkspace owes me. Thats a lot of money that we've been robbed of. I also want my cc information deleted from their program so this can not happen again. 

I would love a response to my emails or voicemails asap.

1,"My regular therapist is on maternity leave for 3 months so I wanted to give this app a try to hold me over until she is back. I was also really interested in seeing if the model might actually work better for me in the long term, and was willing to try the plan with weekly video chats as well as 24/7 messaging. Unfortunately I have not even been able to get signed up. 

When I created an account, I figured I’d be taken to a page where they would want to gather info about me and then offer me a plan to sign up for, then match me with a therapist. Nope. It just took me to a generic landing page with zero instruction. It took me a bit to figure out there was a message from someone who said she would guide me through the intake process. Ok, great! She asked to start with my name and age which I gave her, then she says “hi how can I help”. I let her know I just wanted to get started with the app and she gave me pricing and then asked what prompted me to seek therapy. I responded, then heard nothing back. Later that night I checked in to see if there was anything else we needed to do for this “intake process” she mentioned. No response. This morning, another check in - anything else to get started? No response. 

I do see in the app there is a place to sign up for a membership but why would I want to do that if I can’t even get a response on the intake process?

1,"I had nothing but great things to say about talkspace and my therapist of nearly 2 years, up until recently... now, I would recommend that everyone stay AWAY from this service and this company, who doesn’t seem truly invested in mental well-being at all. 

Without warning, without indication she was taking time away, my therapist stopped responding to messages, there was no formal termination of care, and I haven’t been able to get ahold of her for 3 months now. I can see that she has “read” texts I’ve sent, but they go unanswered. She literally just ghosted on me. I am mentally vulnerable and was dealing with a lot during the Covid pandemic, self isolating for over 400 days due to being high risk. Talkspace doesn’t provide you with any sort of recourse for a situation like this. To make matters worse, there are apparently “no records” covering my care from my therapist, so if I wanted to change providers (inside OR outside of talkspace), I’m going to have to start from literally ground zero. Over 2 years of therapy on talkspace is over $5,000 worth of time that I have spent working on many topics with my therapist, and talkspace is not doing much to help me get my records (which are legally my property). This company treats mental health patients as if they are using a service like Uber. They don’t hold themselves accountable when things go wrong. I’m constantly told how my “concerns are being escalated” but nothing changes. Now, after being abandoned by a provider I trusted and worked with for 2 YEARS, I am afraid to trust another provider. It will take me months, if not years to recover from the trauma of being abandoned by my therapist when I really needed her. Talkspace offers me no solutions of how I can get my records or what I can do. There’s no consequence for the abandonment and I had to fight to get money back for the weeks I went without therapy. 
I’m disappointed— the concept could’ve been great, but clearly there is no protection for patients being really hurt when a therapist on talkspace fails to uphold their professional duty and obligations.

I’m wholeheartedly disappointed and thoroughly traumatized by this very lonely experience",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I struggle with an anxiety disorder and depression. I needed to start speaking with someone quickly and thought this would be a good way to do so while finding a local therapist for tele-visits. 

For the cost of the service I could have had three actual therapy sessions. I heard from the therapist after the time the app told me I would and they explained that they have no control over how many patients they have so they cannot even begin to meet the deadlines set in the app. We’re talking about 100 people being assigned to a single therapist. No one can be expected to provide quality therapy to that many clients. 

Did some more online research and found out that therapists are barely getting paid so why would there be any incentive for them to answer messages let alone provide meaningful responses? So yes, I could switch therapists, but then a person who has done nothing wrong but can’t keep up with Talkspace’s ridiculous client numbers gets penalized and I would just get shifted to another therapist in the same boat. It’s not right for either of us. 

I wish I’d researched them more before signing up but I was in need of help and short on time. Now they have my money, don’t offer refunds and I’m at square one and facing the same issues I signed up to get help managing on my own.  $300+ dollars has given me some generic exercises easily found in any CBT/DBT workbook and an expensive digital journal and no actual therapy. 

I feel cheated out of my therapy budget for the month and will not continue with the service. If you are struggling with any diagnosed condition this is not a good place to seek assistance. While they claim that it’s less expensive than traditional therapy, it’s not and the value for the money is low for both patients and therapists. Talkspace strikes me as a very predatory business taking advantage of already vulnerable people attempting to find legitimate help for actual health concerns. 

Spend your money elsewhere, their business model is harmful to both patients and therapists.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,It cost money and they are kinda rude,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I signed up for Talkspace and tried to get a therapist. First of all, they make you talk to something called a “Matching Agent” who isn’t the therapist. They talk to you about “What brings you to Talkspace?” This is completely wrong because it’s not the therapist. I was kind of tricked into opening up to this person. 

Rates are really bad. 
$65/week for JUST TEXTING. 
$260/month for JUST TEXTING. Oh, and a free 10 minute video session. I didn’t even look beyond this price point. 

Went with the $260. 

Then I picked “my” therapist. I typed to her and typed and typed. She never responded. Talkspace’s response to the FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION of “Why isn’t my therapist answering?”  was a pithy article about how “therapists are humans too” and they’ve got a lot of work to do, or something. I wish I could tell my boss that! 

Instead of an actual solution,  Talkspace offers TWO options: 1) wait for a reply or 2) choose a different therapist. 
(Then what the was all that “matching” for?)
I decided that I had spent WAY too much money to be ignored and wanted my money back. I submitted a request ticket stating that I hadn’t even gotten to use the services and I wanted my money back. They completely ignored my first service request. I ended up submitting 3 more service requests. Still ignored.  

Then, I went on Twitter. The ONLY WAY to get their attention was to get on Twitter and publicly decry them for stealing. I got a DM from whomever was running the Twitter and THEN AND ONLY THEN was I able to get my money back. I still haven’t actually gotten it back, it’s going to take 2-5 business days. 

Suffice it to say, they’re taking advantage of depressed people during a pandemic. The matching specialist never even offered up the fact that they accept insurance until AFTER  you’ve already paid the money. Then, if you want to add your insurance card, that technically starts another “account”, and both accounts will remain open AND auto renew unless you fix it and close the first one. It’s money. Money money money. Don’t use it. Spend the time searching for a REAL therapist that is covered by your insurance.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I was thoroughly disappointed - I thought this would be perfect for me with a busy and irregular schedule. The one live session I scheduled was canceled by talk space because the therapist never confirmed it.

The few responses I did get from the therapist were so boiler plate generic that I'm positive everyone gets exactly the same response. I felt like the after thought obligation of someone trying to ""get their work done"" while running out the door to a party. I sent very thorough messages, waited a long time for a response, then the response was generic, so I elaborated even more and waited again for another generic response. Really no ""therapy"" happening. You could achieve the same therapeutic benefit by just writing in a journal - the responses you get will be just as useful. 

I set up therapy through a local clinic that offers in person or telemedicine. They take my insurance unlike Talkspace, scheduling is easy, and they do therapy live over face time. For the same $260 per month, I could literally have 26 hours of LIVE sessions with a highly trained therapist over face time, due to insurance copay. You'd be surprised how many places are offering similar telemedicine these days. Talk space live session is very short, and I can't speak to how effective it is since my session got canceled. The talk space model is not necessary any more, since most clinics are offering telemedicine due to covid. 

Talkspace only issued a partial refund after I had the service for less than 3 days, literally 4 very generic responses from the therapist, 1 canceled live session, and not responding to my support ticket for multiple days. I sent support an email and got an automatic response which thankfully had instructions for canceling and requesting a refund. Unfortunately the refund is calculated pro rata automatically and I'm waiting for a response from a human being. As of this moment, I'm still out $35. I'm so tired of these companies that make it really easy to spend money, and really difficult to get it back if you're not satisfied.

Hopefully you will find a better experience. For me, it only served to increase the anxiety that I was hoping to relieve.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"A good concept but a disappointing experience.

First, it is very misleading when it says 24/7 chat. Some sort of chat therapy would be a really great thing to have, but that is not talkspace. They should openly say that you will only get one message a day from your provider 5 days a week. This is not what I expected.

The first week is all just about setting up your therapy, and with one message a day and multiple forms to get through, this goes at a snail's pace. It feels as though the therapist are trained to drag out the set up period for as long as possible. So the first week is essentially wasted, but you are still charged for it.

 The other thing which seems unethical about this app is it constantly threatens you that you'll lose your therapist and never be able to pick them again. I feel that if this were a legitimate mental health app and you could not afford a therapist for a couple of months that you should be able to get back your old therapist no matter how much time has gone by. Your issues are personal and therapy is meant to build on your relationship with a therapist.  

*Edit* To their credit the support team did refund me which I am very grateful for. 

I found my therapist online which seemed like he had his own practice, but when I messaged him saying that the Talkspace format was not going to work out for me and that I wanted regular therapy sessions, he said he was sorry and that he could only offer therapy through Talkspace. 

This was just my experience with one therapist but it makes me question the credibility of the therapists on talkspace, I'm just not sure if they are real or not. Either way, one text a day just wasn't going to work for me. :(",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"I’m an ER nurse and single mom who was in between insurances. You got me to sign up for one price that I agreed to then overcharged me over DOUBLE the following month when I barely had time to utilize services. 

I’m also canceling because you guys have a poor app and poor customer service with no receipt of acknowledgement that a “ticket” or email was received with an anticipated response time. 

Don’t create an app to make money off of the vulnerabilities of people with no intention of actually helping, only getting paid. With the amount of money you guys charge and therapists you have I’d think you'd have enough to pay a human to sit behind a 1-800 number. Very disappointing because my therapist Danielle was phenomenal.

For anyone wanting to use this app: don’t fall for the “deal” they give you to sign up. Also don’t pay for the audio and video chat options at first unless you think you will utilize them. I paid for them and the options were never offered to me so it was a waste. Also, they want this review to be about my “provider” not any “app or site” issues lol because they clearly have MANY. They cost more than an actual therapist!

Also, please don’t respond to this review with how “sorry” you are (NOT) and giving me your feedback@talkspace email as you have copied and pasted with every other bad review. I’ve emailed you multiple times with NO response.

1,"I signed up for Talkspace at the beginning of November of 2020 after realizing I needed to seek counseling for my general anxiety and severe insecurity and social anxiety. Like most people who struggle with these things, particularly social anxiety, it took a great deal of courage to take the step to get help, especially because I had never been through therapy before due to cost and extreme hesitancy to reach out for professional help. This is something I mentioned repeatedly to my therapist and the matching representative throughout my brief time with Talkspace. 

I was assigned to a therapist named Lisa within a day or two of signing up with Talkspace. I was very open with my deep sense of imposter syndrome and social anxiety and though I wasn’t in immediate peril, it was really important for me to talk to someone so I could regain control of my life. It was going fine until I received a notification that my therapist would be on vacation until the end of December. At this point, it was around November 8, and I’d used Talkspace for less than a week. Neither Lisa nor Talkspace gave me any prior notification that she would be gone or gave me a substitute—or, assigned me to a therapist who didn’t have a month and a half vacation planned. Instead, the automated notification in my chat with Lisa said I was encouraged to keep sending messages to her so I could write down my feelings and she’d get back to me when she returned from vacation. Yes, Talkspace expected me to continue paying the fee for a MONTH AND A HALF while I message myself in an echo chamber. Especially as a person who struggles with self image and feeling valued by others—which, again, I made very clear to everyone at Talkspace I talked with—this was a massive blow and completely undid what little therapy Lisa had provided me. 

I emailed Talkspace explaining the situation in detail, how horrible it made me feel, how irresponsible both Talkspace and Lisa were, and asking for a refund. I received a very sterile automated response telling me to fill out a form so I could get my refund, and everything I had written about my displeasure with my experience fell completely on deaf ears. I felt so insignificant, which was intensified by the fact that it was a therapy service that supposedly made counseling affordable, accessible, and empowering. It did none of those things for me. 

I had very high hopes for Talkspace and thought I was doing myself good by accepting that I needed help, but all I received in return was invalidation and a complete distrust of therapy.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I am thankful to my therapist for being responsive, and checking in at least once a day. He was also respectful and professional. I did get 1-2 nuggets of useful advice. However, I found the therapy lacking in many ways and ultimately unhelpful. I was hoping for insight into my situations, but most responses I got were very basic—either easily googled or common sense. Still I was hopeful and wanted to give it a chance. I reiterated my goals with my therapist so he knew I wasn’t just here to vent, that I was looking for deeper understanding of what was going on. I continued to find the responses more of repetitions of what I said rather than anything I could learn from. I even tried nudging him in the right direction by suggesting possible explanations I learned from my own reading, hoping he would delve deeper. In response my therapist would agree with me and give a one sentence “elaboration.” I felt he was just trying to keep me happy and “feeling heard,” but I couldn’t get much depth or new information from him. He honestly seemed to be trying his best but either through lack of skill/knowledge or the format’s limitations, this therapy did not deliver. After a few weeks I found that answering the messages felt like a chore. I responded to the therapist just to get it off my to do list. I wasn’t getting anything useful from it.

 

Btw, I was a little put off that I had to include an emergency contact’s full name and phone number. I had hoped for some anonymity due to the personal nature of things I would talk about. I tried to give just a first name, but he would not continue without a first AND last name, and phone number. 

Overall, from my experience I don’t think this format of therapy is going to help people looking for real therapy. The delay in response time (which to be fair, they warn you about) and that it’s written, makes it hard to connect or get deeper. Not sure who this would work for? It really makes me wonder about the validity of some of these reviews.... If you want to pay $300+ a month for someone to read your texts and agree with you then sure. But I regret opening up about highly personal things and spending the money I did. I feel I can get better information googling mental health advice than from this.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I wanted to like this app so much.. but no.. 

I’m a very straightforward person. I told my backstory, how that effects me, and how I’d like to improve, and what type of things I expected from therapy/needed.

The first therapist was an okay person, but bad therapist.. He literally compared every “problem” of mine to a bigger problem he had once in his life. He provided no coping mechanisms. And talked like a fortune cookie. No help whatsoever. He made life sound like a sad existence that you just have to get used to... No Thanks!!

Second therapist was a young woman who just sounded really cocky after we actually talked. Like she knew everything and how to fix everything. But didn’t actually try to “fix” anything. And basically belittled me and told me what I thought was wrong and sent a passive aggressive message “proving” me wrong. 

Third one seemed like she would have been actually helpful. Helped me learn a breathing technique right away. But we didn’t really talk as much as I hoped we could. And by this point, I wasn’t really willing to waste more time and money on this app. 

As I was trying to cancel my subscription they kept offering me cheaper and cheaper deals and plans. Not sure if it was because they actually want to provide help to less fortunate people, or because they want any and all money they can get...

Either way, it would be nice if they could screen their employees before letting them actually see patients. People deserve great mental health care and I’ve seen a couple subpar therapists right off the bat. Real therapy can and should help you. And it shouldn’t be this hard to find a good therapist. I feel very sorry for all the people taking there first step towards getting better, just to end up with subpar health “professionals”.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,

1,"I’ve never done therapy before so this was the first time I tried getting help for myself which is  a big step for me. After having this app for a couple months I’m ready to delete it. My first therapist would take days to respond, her messages were basic and it felt like she wasn’t listening. After a week of having that therapist she took a break without telling me and I couldn’t wait a week when I just got started so I switched. My new therapist was great in the beginning she responded fast and  short it was like someone was actually listening to me and it wasn’t a robot. But to be honest she wasn’t the best sometimes she would only listen to half of  what I said. These past 2 weeks have really convinced me to delete this app after telling her about my past she left me on read for 4 days finally she responded ignoring my message and told me to talk about my trauma. I told her more of my past and she left me on read once again then 2 days later the app told me she was taking a 11 day break. This app is seriously a joke I’ve been on this app for months and feel like nothing for me has improved. If you are really looking for help don’t look here because you won’t get it. I had  more anxiety these past couple months just from waiting around for the therapists to message me. I question if these therapists have license to practice.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,I decided to give Talkspace a try after hearing so many great reviews from YouTube influencers smh. Big mistake! Even after seeing nothing but bad ratings on the app I still wanted to see for myself and it was honestly a waste of $280. I spoke to a therapist for 10 minutes just as an introduction and after that one interaction I knew we were not a good match. I reached out to Talkspace to switch therapists and was told they were looking for a better match and I would hear back from someone in 24 hours. I literally did not hear from ANYONE after that conversation and it’s been an entire month! I requested a full refund just to be denied one. Please believe the 1 star ratings and do not waste your money!!! I would give them 0 stars if I could!,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I’ve been trying to talk myself into starting therapy for at least a year. I finally decided to try Talkspace because it’s advertised on The Read and I wanted to use their code. I should’ve trusted my gut when I signed up and it wouldn’t allow me to use my own promo code. 

I signed up 6/1/22 and was matched to a provider the same day. I booked an appointment with her and got a message later telling me she was unavailable at that time (I chose it from a calendar showing she was available; another red flag). We went back and forth a couple times and found no coordination in our schedules, so I tried to match with another provider. I got a message stating they couldn’t match me and to click a button that would take me to a matching agent. The matching agent appears to be a bot and sent a message that day saying to check back tomorrow for a provider. Lol never got one. I sent several messages asking to be matched or to get me to someone to help. According to the read receipts they saw all my messages but never responded. 

I submitted a ticket through the app explaining the situation and asking for help or to be refunded. No response. My account was stuck in limbo not letting me request a new provider or anything. Today I cancelled my renewal and once I did that clicked something saying “need more help?”. That allowed me to request a refund, but of course it’s a prorated refund because it’s been a week that I’ve have the subscription. Even though I’ve had NO SESSIONS and am not even matched. 

This was the worst outcome for simply seeking help. I would never recommend Talkspace to anyone. I just want a full refund, to speak with a real human. But of course there is no phone number to call, no real people to speak with. I’m so disappointed and this will make it that much harder for me to try to start therapy again.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"ZERO live customer service or even responsive chat options to help straighten out difficulties. 

I had to forfeit half of my money because time had wasted while I waited for help…

I live remotely and was desperate to find couples therapy so thought I had found a great solution with Talkspace. 

Theoretically yes. When it came down to trying to find a licensed couples therapist, the field narrowed fast and the matches schedule never lined up with ours. 

So let’s move on, get a refund and try again or try something else.

Nope. They have a Wacked refund policy likely noted somewhere in fine print of sign up that takes chunks of your payment away the longer you take to apply for a refund. 

We literally got no services and had to forfeit half of our $316.00

1,Just started using talk space and will not be using any longer. App matched me with a therapist with a 1 star review and several complaints.

2,"Signed up under a promo code, but usually it costs about 400 a month for one weekly half hour session and daily texting. It’s not that afford or great of a deal.

The daily texting is pretty useless. You get one response back a day from therapist and all the responses I got back we’re pretty useless. Usually just “how did that make you feel” sorta responses, didn’t add much value.

My therapist also cancelled our scheduled appointment twice so I never even really got to book a session with him for our first month.

He was in the hospital apparently but talkspace wouldn’t refund me any of the month except prorated of what was left despite never even really getting any value out of the service.

Overall I wouldn’t say it’s very useful or affordable. The daily messaging is somewhat useless and 400 dollars for 2 hours of phone time isn’t exactly cheap etc.

1,"I start off by saying that initially signing up for TalkSpace I encountered numerous issues, one of them was able to resolve the issue and connect me with a provider that I genuinely liked talking with but out of no where, my coverage of using TalkSpace was gone when I had initially put the information in. I have Cigna and have already talked with them and they had told me that I was covered for TalkSpace. When I brought up the issue with the customer support, they took more than 5 days to reply to my issue at hand and suggested the same solution that I had already tried and didn’t work. I have put in at least 3 tickets dealing with the same issue and the customer support person was the same and told me the same thing. This has been going on for about a month now and I am fed up with it. There is no other form of communication other than emailing them and that doesn’t work. They need a customer support line as this is absolutely ridiculous that I am not able to get a manager or anyone other than the same tech person to help me resolve this problem. Not to mention that I am not able to set up a video session with my provider as the system does not appear to connect me with my provider. If I could I would’ve given it less stars as the system and app do not match with the service being provided. These are people that are dealing with mental health issues and shouldn’t have to be stressed out over not being able to talk with their therapist as they are paying for a service provided.

If you have any trouble matching with your original provider I can assist with switching you over, but please be sure to select a therapist at the end of the process regardless to finish making your new room. Once you have made a new room that includes your coverage, let me know and we can proceed with closing the invalid room.

1,"THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM. I requested for them to cancel my account on February 5th and asked if I could get a refund for the first months service (260 dollars) which I signed up for on February 1st. The one therapy provider who got in touch with me was a no show and sent me a total of two messages trying to schedule a time we could talk (she never showed up for the time we arranged). I requested another therapy provider who also never got in touch. So ultimately in February I was charged 260 dollars for NO THERAPEUTIC help whatsoever. 

Customer service cancelled my TICKET for customer service, where I asked that they cancel my account and if possible provide a refund. It’s now March 1st and I see another charge for 260 dollars. 

So they have altogether stolen 520 dollars for me. Not to mention, throughout my subscription I got ZERO THERAPEUTIC HELP. I was unable to talk to a SINGLE PERSON/THERAPIST. 

Do yourself a favor and find a real therapist through headway.co, which is ultimately what I ended up having to do. They can pair you with a provider who actually takes your insurance so that the charge is just for the copay.

This is not what a client wants to hear when seeking an avenue to work through his or her own stuff. Therefore, I switched therapists, had to share all of my issues a second time (not sure why he couldn’t simply read the chat record), and he never responded once in two weeks after stating that he would once a day.

I had to look it up and ask her.

 The second time was when I saw refer a friend link from a YouTube video and when I resigned up, I was greeted by another lady who pretended to want to know how I feel and then pushed plans in my face. 

I was kinda turned off only because after why I wanted help and the steps I took and how it was my first time and that I honestly didn’t know what I wanted or got myself into she just didn’t care and pushed a plan at me once again.

Erica asked me why i downloaded the app,  and i wrote about 3 sentences explaining my situation. she asked me to pay $200 ish dollars and i said i am interested but would rather try my free therapy first . she said “we do not offer free therapy” . i sent her the code and she said it is $100 off rather than free. This left me feeling even worse than I was, and it was because of this apps intentional misleading marketing.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,Purchased the 3 month deal for a 30 minute meeting once a week for 800$ - had a discount code and got it down to 580$. Therapists was great but I was soon told I got 1 30 min session once a both ... asked for a refund and was denied ... total waste of money is a very tough time / was laid off .... my best friend is a therapist and was considering doing this and I strongly recommended he does not and he’s telling his professional community,talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
2,"This is definitely a life-saving, life-changing service and I am glad it has come into my life, however the app developers really need to A improve the app in general but also B consider their clientele in the app building. By that I mean, I use this app service because I am someone who going to a brick and mortar building for a traditional therapy appointment is difficult, remembering the appointments is difficult for me, executive dysfunction is a huge issue for me and I’m sure for a lot of other people who use this app. So why is it that I can get a little red notification bubble for anything from angry birds to YouTube to tinder to amazon to literally any other app in the world, but the service that I am *paying for* doesn’t show me a notification that my therapist has texted me back? I’m not checking my app 15 times a day to see when my therapist has texted me back, and I do get banners that say that they messaged me but if I don’t respond as soon as I see that banner (which let’s be honest, most of us don’t always have time to respond to messages as soon as we get them) then it gets lost, and there is no reminder bubble like literally every other app out there. I’m mad because I’m paying for this service and I go 5 days thinking my therapist hasn’t texted me back, or missing video sessions because the notifications don’t work like a normal app, and if I and thousands of other people are paying for this service the least you can do is hire a developer who can get the notifications right so I am aware that I’m not just waiting on a message back from my therapist.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"Okay facts: the cheapest plan is 240 per month. No insurance will be applied. 

I really needed to talk so I thought it might be worth it. This doesn’t give you live chats with help. The therapist will reply once per day 5 days per week. That’s it.

 I tried 2 therapists. I took their surveys and they confirmed my prior diagnosis and labeled it severe. 
Let me give you an example of exchange: 
Me: So what can I do to work on this? (After no talk for 3 1/2 days)
Hours later: therapist copied and pasted links to Wikipedia and YouTube...
I reply: yeah but we never said this was an issue for me... So can you please help me with this issue you said I actually have. It’s day 4 with you and I’ve got nothing? 
Therapist: thanks for the feedback. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.

That was the entire day. 

Honestly the ad says you can chat with someone then but the first therapist I matched with sent an auto message Friday evening that he would check his messages Monday morning and reply then or Monday at 5 each day. That’s it. 

Again there is no back and forth chat. I haven’t had one piece of help. It costs as much as any other therapy more with certain plans.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,,,
1,"I don’t know if I just got one crazy outlier of a therapist but my therapist seemed completely unqualified and spit up all the trauma back into my face when I didn’t comply with her orders anymore such as take antipsychotics and take antidepressants and go to the hospital and do IOP and do this and that. She would ask inappropriate sexual questions, seemed to not understand why I was in therapy, do the bare minimum and repeat the same thing she did every single week and would constantly threaten to call ambulances and cops. It seems like this platform is good for crazy therapists like her who can jump from platform to platform and not have their name tarnished because they don’t answer to superiors they’re just freelance and can bounce any time they get a bad review. There’s a reason they’re not in therapy offices in town. This is $60 a week for the cheapest price and the therapist can just take a week or two off and not notify you and you still have to pay the $60 each week that you’re subscribed to this plan. They can also just fire you at any moment to and not give you any referrals and no notice. I feel like BetterHelp gets such high reviews because they pay people to write good things about them. I don’t know guys, I definitely wouldn’t recommend this app. You’re much better off finding a cheap therapist through your insurance, they’re probably much much much more qualified than they would be here.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"First, the app and website are hard to navigate at first. For instance, my first therapist wasn’t showing available slots for me to book. There’s nothing on Better Help’s site/app to let me know I had to wait for him to open up slots. I also wish that in general, I knew what my therapists hours are before being matched because their hours are often not my hours. 

Second, I found scheduling to be very difficult. I’ve tried two therapists and both were extremely difficult to schedule. I also wish there were reviews for some therapists. I know that sometimes it’s not a fit, but the second therapist I was seeing showed up 5-15 minutes late every time and cut off the sessions 5 minutes early so we never had time to talk about anything. After the third time, I realized her excuses were not legitimate, and she was just not interested in being helpful. This level of unprofessional behavior should be something others know about so they don’t go through the same frustration. 

Lastly, I dislike how I would receive so many notifications to remind me about my appointment but nothing for billing. Now I’m on the hook for another month of therapy despite having had two bad months of experience (or non experience given the lack of therapist availability).",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I’ve been through a lot of different therapists/counselors who have failed me and this one did not break the mold. First of all, it’s too expensive for the amount of time you get with your person. I forget what the exact price is but it’s around $50 a month just to see your person once a week for only 30 minutes! That’s ridiculous. I appreciate the concept and the software itself is fine but the person I was connected with had an incident on the second week. Keep in mind the first session was basically nothing since it takes more than 30 minutes just to introduce each other. In reality it’s around 20 minutes if you take into account that it takes a while to connect and the person decides to leave early. Anyway the person I had had canceled all her appointments and had basically wasted two weeks or roughly $20. The people who run the service tried to compensate me by adding two extra weeks but by that point I wasn’t feeling well about the app. None of the people that were open had schedules that made sense for me and the extra time they gave was just going to be used by introduction. Make it at least an hour which is typical for therapy or counseling. By the time you actually talk about the tough situations, you’ve already spent more than $50",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I was really excited about this app as I live in a rural area where most of the counselors and therapists are very faith-based and conservative (both of which i am not), but the price of therapy on this app is insanely expensive. $80/week (one month is billed at once for a total of nearly $400) is WAY more required disposable income than i was expecting. In addition, BetterHelp does not accept insurance—or if they do, they make it very difficult to find any info on it. They also do not offer any sort of substantial financial aid or assistance. I am a disabled, unemployed student and was offered a discounted rate of $60/week, which is still insane.

I switched to Cerebral immediately and for nearly the same price right off the bat ($85/month, with a discounted rate of $30 for your first month), I can get access to a prescribing doctor, counselor, AND therapist and have medications mailed to my door. In addition to this, they readily accept insurance.

I am giving two stars because BetterHelp does seem to have a wide range of professionals available—from relationship issues to mental health to chronic illness—but the cost is way too much for me and discounts are laughable. I will be switching to their competitor for good.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I’ve had betterhelp for about two weeks. In that time, it took me 6 days to get matched to a counselor, I was repeatedly prompted to tell more about myself so they could match me up. I contacted customer service and said “what more can I give you to assist you” kinda thing, no response. I didn’t know what they needed to know and what would make it better, so I started going into my past and reasons for therapy etc. still no response. Then I get matched to a counselor. She seems nice. She messages me ONCE A DAY at like 9:30-11:00 PM only M-T. I reply about 8:30AM usually, only to hear back over 12 hours later. Every time I respond, it digs up all the emotions you typically unpack in therapy. However, since it’s so spread out with hardly ANYTHING being covered (she’s been my therapist for a week). I want to get another therapist just so I’ll have someone to schedule a call with and actually reap the benefits I paid for with counseling but I’m afraid it’ll take another week to match me up with someone! in theory i really dig the idea but in reality I just dredge up strong emotions daily with no conversation to direct them, Ive been in a bad mood all week bc I keep having to talk about stuff and I haven’t even heard back since I messaged her Thursday after she asked me to unpack some heavy stuff!",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"O my God guys I literally do not recommend this app to anyone. Trust my story. I subscribed and paid for therapy session. And set up my first session at 10 am in the morning. Everything started good. The therapist was a man, we start talking and he was completely not interested to me at all. He yawned like ten times and I asked him if he was ok. And can you imagine?! He fell asleep during the session!!!! I paid almost $70 for 30 min session and he fell asleep!!! Ok I thought it happens sometimes. Then I changed my therapist and the second one was a woman. And It was much more terrible experience than the first one. She literally told me to hold on during her session and start talking to someone on her phone. I was expecting it would take like 2-5 min. And was trying to understand but she kept talking more than 10 minutes!!! And imagine i paid almost $70 for 30 minutes session and half of this time she was talking with someone else on the phone. Like come on BetterHelp, your both therapist was very unprofessional and I am very disappointed. Cause I saw so many targeted ads in every social media and was hoping it will work. Even I explained you what happened BetterHelp never tried to compensate me at least half of the price I paid to them. Shame on you!!!",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I signed up for better help in hopes that I can deal with my anxiety issues. I matched with a therapist in a few minutes once I signed up. The therapist had a very limited schedule but I managed to fit my schedule to meet. After the second session, I didn’t think my therapist was helpful. It felt more of a conversation (that I would have with friends/family) about my future plans and life versus actually staying on topic with my anxiety issues. The only advice she ever gave me was to “stay in the moment.” I made a third session in hopes we would discuss ways to deal with my issues. She rescheduled last minute with me on my third session. The third session was such a waste. I contacted BetterHelp for a refund on my last week and it was easy to get the refund. They gave me a complementary week. I decided to get a new therapist and see if maybe this therapist would be better. The new therapist was helpful and I felt heard. I made another session and continued with therapy… only to wake up to a message from my new therapist saying she was leaving the platform. What a joke. My experience with BetterHelp added more stress in my life! The only good thing about this platform were the webinars.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I know this is a great app and I’m guessing this is an issue on my part but it is still very frustrating. I am struggling with money but my mental health comes first, so I paid 260 for the month and then decided to cancel it but I got distracted and it was too late. I thought nothing much of it; get advice and care for a month and pay again IF I can afford it. I scheduled for an appointment and then suddenly I got a new counselor. No big deal, but when I tried to make a new appointment it told me to pay again. Now I can’t buy it again because I will be negative in my account, and I made of the mistake of the purchase without saving money but I wasn’t too worried because I thought that this was my chance to get help and treatment. I don’t know if I want a full refund back because I have little hope it would be refundable or if I’m able to get the month subscription back. I’m rating this a 1 star so this can get someone’s attention, and hopefully I don’t have to make an upsetting call trying to get my money back which is something I need but if it’s against policy then I should have my subscription back. But either way, I canceled counseling which I think is equal to canceling my account, so hopefully I get my money back.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I signed up April 1st but didn’t get matched for a therapist until April 5th. It took longer than expected to get matched. I talked to a therapist on April 7th but honestly I didn’t feel a great connection with her. I told her how I felt and that I have depression and anxiety, she told me I needed to go to a psychiatrist to get medications to get more help. Talking to a therapist didn’t help me but to be nice I told her it did. It was nice talking to someone but again, I felt no connection. There’s no point in keeping the membership if I have to spend more money to get help elsewhere. Also, I contacted BetterHelp to ask about finding a psychiatrist because the therapist told me they can help me but they messaged me back saying they couldn’t. Again, BetterHelp wasn’t helpful for my depression and anxiety but that’s my opinion. I’m sure for others it helps. If you’re looking to get medication prescribed then this app/website isn’t for you but if you want to talk to a therapist then make sure you have a good connection with them. If you get matched with a therapist that you don’t feel comfortable with then you can always let BetterHelp know so they can help with finding another one for you.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"“Unlimited” therapy is not what one would assume it is. You can only schedule ONE session per week. The unlimited part just means you can text someone as many times as you’d like in between. The system will not allow you to have any more than one session scheduled at a time!! This is incredibly frustrating and entirely misleading. I can get a normal therapist who also lets me email them for much less money. By the way, it takes a few days to even be matched with a therapist, so you’re paying $55 to stare at a useless app until that happens. I liked the therapist that they paired me with, but I need more consistent therapy at the moment. I might have stuck with this but the platform is deceitful and that’s the last thing I need in my life right now. So, if you’re up for paying $55 for 1 phone or video session per week (if you pay for the weekly plan, other subscriptions may be less), or if you don’t have health insurance that covers therapy, then this is a great option for you. Otherwise you might be better off getting help from a normal therapist that accepts insurance if you can go that route.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"BetterHelp, a website that purports to help people find mental stability, misled and gaslighted me with the navigation of their website design. I pressed a button to “browse therapists” and it charged me an exorbitant amount that is not even available in my bank account. I have the mental clarity to know when $260 can and can’t be charged on my bank account but perhaps that is where BetterHelp is placing their bets. Exploiting people in their time of need. Nowhere on or near that button did it say that I was agreeing to pay by pressing that button. Nowhere on the site had I entered my new card information. The platform had creepily held onto my PayPal login information for two years, without my knowledge, which is where my new card info was entered.  Two years ago is too far for me to even remember I signed up in a dire moment. I don’t even remember the therapist I supposedly paid $100 to talk to. Their billing department has not gotten back to me. PayPal has denied revoking the transaction. There is no way to call billing department only email. I ended up finding a number to text on BetterHelp site and talked to an unaffiliated crisis prevention counselor about it. I can’t believe this is how they operate made even more unbelievable by the covid crisis.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Probably ok for someone looking for a listening ear but NOT for someone living with mental illness. I’ve worked for a decade with a psychiatrist and for quite a while with a psychologist on a clinically diagnosed mood disorder only to have some jabroni I met with four times tell me he didn’t think I had a diagnosis and “moods change.” I didn’t work through all the pain of an illness to reach a place of stability and self-acceptance for someone who barely knows me or my history to tell me I don’t actually have an illness at all. 

And I mean BARELY got to know me. I signed up to discuss relationship issues and over the course of four weeks I learned all about this guy’s divorce, how his ex-wife cheated and is with someone new, his honeymoon to the city I live in, the book he’s writing about mating patterns and how people usually break up in springtime(??), and how he can “see” where his patients were headed and was there to “guide” them. Was looking for a psychotherapist, not a psychic! 

I learned from some therapist friends that BetterHelp pays their therapists $30/hr, so you’re getting what they pay for your therapy.  Advekit is a better option if you have insurance.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Besides BetterHelp stating they wouldn’t charge me until I was paired with a counselor, they charged my card the same day as signup, and then took an additional SIX days to find a counselor for me. As well, I turned to betterhelp to manage my anxiety and trauma so it wouldn’t relapse again. During the video call the counselor stated “well you seem to have your life under control so why would you turn to therapy” (before I had even mentioned the situation that made me join). As well, she felt very inattentive playing with something off screen and barely looked at the camera. Then, despite her mentioning she would be around to talk 24/7 (which I know can be an exaggeration), I sent two very long messages that I felt were desperate and it took her TWO days to respond and she messaged me at 12:40am. I understand the therapists are busy. They have a lot of clients but where betterhelp really turned be off was her reply was “I don’t know your situation so I can’t give you advice. You don’t have to do anything if you don’t want to” in response to childhood trauma. I wish it worked out better for me because I could see myself using it but they don’t seem to care about their customers too much.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"While BetterHelp has been extremely helpful in terms of providing a more affordable option for online therapy, the way they handle payments for subscriptions is stupid and manipulative. There is no warning whatsoever that the subscription will expire soon so that you can be prepared to pay to renew it, and once your subscription expires it will automatically cancel your appointment (even though the system allowed it to be scheduled) and lock you out of communicating with your therapist until payment is processed. 

Especially when you are providing service to a community who struggles to afford traditional therapy, this feels extremely manipulative and shady. It isn’t that hard to include the subscription “valid through” date on the website/app dashboard, send a reminder 2 weeks before the subscription expires, or lock the scheduling in the system when a subscription expires so that a client and therapist can see that they can’t schedule the following week until a payment goes through. If other companies can do this, BetterHelp should be able to as well.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Ive had this app for a month now, supposed to get unlimited messages and weekly live sessions. 1st therapist scheduled me almost 3 weeks out from my original message, i was fine with it, maybe she has a lot of other clients, whatever… then she straight up ghosted me on our first session with no reason or excuse. Her name was Rebecca Edwards. My second therapist seemed very spiritual and i had high hopes she would be better, until she scheduled me a week and a half out and again canceled our appointment day of just 2 hours before. While i appreciate ms Angelica Bennet cancelling beforehand, not after, why did she do it day of?? again with very short explanation “sorry i have to cancel today im sick” was her only response. So it has been one month now and i have received a total of ZERO help. I was not going to renew and pay another $320 to get canceled on again next month. $640 for what?? one session?? I thought this app would help, i really did. but it has only cause me more stress and heightened my abandonment anxiety. wish i could get a refund. highly do not recommend this app.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"For a mental health app they sure do trick you. They charge you 200 something for your first month without telling you or making it clearly known that there are cheaper options available. The 200 covers webinars and counseling and a free journal platform plus 24/7 access to your therapist. But be careful… your therapist will probably offer to text, call, or video chat for your live sessions. If you choose to do something like text or call there’s actually a cheaper rate for those services. I was using the calling method for weeks and being charged that 200 for it when I could’ve been paying 160. Be wary of your therapist as well. I went my first two weeks without talking to someone because my therapist had a mishap with her schedule, then finally, when I was able to see her and I logged into my appointment 15 minutes early just to see she cancelled my appointment for not having a profile picture. Which I could’ve done in three minutes. My second therapist didn’t remember who I was and ate while she was in session with me. She was very nice but it was just disappointing.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I tried using this app because it was a little bit more affordable than seeing a therapist face to face. I was matched with a counselor but she only responded to me once every day or two, & didn't really help me with any of my problems. She just sent me worksheets, & sent me short messages that were difficult to respond back to because of how short & bland they were. Because of my work schedule, I’m not able to use the features of the app like live chats & things like that, I feel like it may have been more helpful had I been able to use those but I still don’t recommend this app as a substitute for face to face therapy. I was spending $45 a week to get one response a day that did not help me or make me feel any better. Even when writing large messages to her, she responded very seldom, very short answers, & most of what she said was to fill out work sheets or to use other features of the app like the journal or the groupinars. When I cancelled today (March 5th), I was not able to get my $180 back that I was charged for the month of March. I was told I can use the app until April 5th but I can’t get a refund.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"Since the beginning the site/ app was pushy for feedback and positive reviews without really having offered much. Paying that much per week or month for an online journal, a counselor that yes you can write at anytime but they will only respond every other day or so with less than in depth feedback wasn’t really what I was looking for. You also can only book 1 therapy appointment at a time. You’re unable to view your therapists schedule to book in advance besides one appointment. So if you’re busy you’re scrambling to fit in an appointment each week after your session and it’ll be a different time each time so planning ahead isn’t an option. The company is HUGE on promoting. Pushing for feedback with automated systems after every minor step was annoying. It’s expensive to most of us who don’t have a lot of extra money to spend on a subscription that doesn’t offer efficient help. That’s in a nutshell how I would describe it. Expensive for inefficient service.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I signed up thinking I’d give the virtual therapy thing a try. Every single therapist I was matched with only had openings in the morning or dead smack in the middle of the day. The profiles say they can accommodate schedules outside of theirs availability, but that is a lie. When I brought up the fact that I would like to attend live sessions but the availability doesn’t work for my schedule, she recommended I try the weekend. I went to her schedule and there was no availability for the upcoming 3 weeks. Her response was, yeah.. i’m booked up pretty far in advance. Which is fine but why charge me for a service i don’t even have access to????? Now I’m out of $256, with no type of refund in sight. I’ve never been able to even attend a live session. I feel like if I’m going to take off work for therapy I’m going to go to an in person session. Im not taking off work to talk on the phone. Honestly, the whole ordeal felt like a scam. They only wanted to text with me and they responded 3-4 hours after the fact. Don’t waste your money. Just find an in-person therapist.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I would talk to my therapist for about 20 mins and I don’t think that’s long enough to cover much.  I felt I didn’t really get anything from it. Maybe I need a different therapist but I’m not going to spend another 400 to find out.  I get more out of self help books. Anyway, I felt my therapist always just wanted to get off the phone or text.  What really turned me off was me discussing my own issues and she ended it with “well, I think what’s more scary are the people who are supposed to serve and protect”.  Ummmm, we are not talking about what’s going on in the states.  We are discussing me, I don’t know why or how police officers got thrown in there.  She didn’t seem like she had any advice or ideas for me. Too bad they don’t give out refunds cuz I wasted money on this.

*i did email customer service, who was great and they gave me a partial refund for sessions I didn’t use.  She also offered me an extra two weeks with a different therapist but after some thought, I decided not to go with that option. So A+ on customer service. I really appreciate it.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"It really saddens me to leave this review, as I used to sincerely love BetterHelp. I love my counselor, and I love the accessibility of this platform. But my counselor told me during my last session that they are cutting the reserved one hour slot down to 50 minutes, and eventually down to 45 minutes. That means I have 25% less time to talk with my counselor.
That in itself isn’t the issue, but the fact that I had to hear that from my counselor, NOT BetterHelp, is another part of the problem. Also, I’ve found out that BetterHelp will not be lowering their monthly price, despite them lowering my therapy time.
This is a platform built for people like myself with mental health issues, and they made a MAJOR change without transparency. This wreaks of corporate greed, and I could not be more disappointed.
I’d highly recommend online therapy for anyone whose thinking about it. Do it!!!!! It’s 100% worth it!

1,"Signed up for the app, thought I was paying $80/week, but apparently that’s not the case. After 4 days I canceled my subscription because I decided it wasn’t right for me. I was okay with eating the $80 cost but then I found out I would be charged $320 for a full month of a service I’m not going to use??! Now I’m out $240 that I could put towards food, gas, mortgage, other psychiatric care that I can actually use- thanks BetterHelp!

This is extorting people who are in bad enough shape mentally to decide that virtual “therapy” is their only option. I signed up because I was in emotional distress 24/7 and absolutely desperate for help. I live in a metropolitan area with many options for therapy and no one- I mean literally no one- is accepting new patients. This was supposed to “help” while I wait for an opening, but it’s awful. I’ve switched therapists so many times because everyone has just been so cold and most have very little availability- some of them have just one session available a MONTH. $320 for one session? NO.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,There is no way to contact anyone on the phone for the app. You have to email and wait 24 hours for a response. I’ve been paying for the app for 3 weeks and I still haven’t been about to get counseling. The app asks you if you would like a male/female counselor but they matched me with 2 men before I found a women- then the female counselor said she thought I needed in person help and suggested somewhere in town (she also said she would no longer be working for betterhelp). I’m now on my 4th counselor and I still can’t schedule a video chat until my counselor has responded to a message. Everything takes so long because everyone involved is taking the full 24 hours to respond. There is no communication between the app and the counselors. If you really need help and can’t wait and also have had trouble with feelings of abandonment.... don’t use this app. If anyone on this app team is reading the reviews- please please please add a phone number for people who need assistance.,betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I decided to try betterhelp because it seemed reasonably priced, and easier for my schedule. i was matched with a counselor that seemed fine at first. i told her all of my past trauma which i have not done with many people, so it was difficult and exhausting for me to do so. she had me write a letter to my father, and i read it to her during our 2nd session together. then on our third session, she asks me: “did you ever write a letter to your father?” clearly not paying attention/taking notes. i felt like she was not listening to me at all, and there was multiple things she said to me that seemed very unempathetic. i ended my counseling with her after she very abruptly ended our session with no advice for me. i feel worse now than i did before, and am not interested in trying a different therapist. it was already very difficult and exhausting for me to open up to one person (who didn’t listen), and i don’t think it’d be worth it to try again with any of their therapists.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"After the absolute waste and time of money of using this app, I almost gave up on counseling altogether and haven’t been to a therapist in months. One example was a therapist telling me to read his profile after I’d already sent him a hello message mentioning that I read his profile and was excited to speak with him. The same therapist overlooked an entire paragraph I sent to him about my depressed thoughts/feelings, no acknowledgement of the message AT ALL and instead told me to read his profile (again) and complete the intake form. Which I’d already done. I wasn’t blowing the guy up with messages either. One or two initial messages and he couldn’t bother to read. Fed up with therapists who don’t actually want to help!! If they’re overwhelmed with clients, they should say that instead of half assing it and making clients feel insignificant/ignored. I wish this had worked out but the whole idea of the app was a lie for me and proved to be 2x more expensive than just paying a regular in person therapist.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"When I signed up for the app, I completed the profile questions. It didn’t save my answers correctly because apparently I had made an account before. Instead of saving my correct answers, it imported my old answers, which are not relevant. Unfortunately, I had already been charged $, so I didn’t want to have to go through the effort of changing it.

I was matched with a counselor who didn’t work for my needs. The app advertises live chat sessions and the counselors profile said that was offered. She told me via messages that she would do phone or video, which I am not comfortable with or capable of doing right now. The app advertises you can change counselors, but there is NOWHERE where this is an option. I checked both in the app and on the website. 

Naturally, after these issues, I contacted support for help in changing counselors. I have yet to hear back and am actively being charged for this service. This is a waste of money. Avoid BetterHelp at all costs. It seems like a scam.",betterhelp-therapy,,,

So I choose a different questionnaire and specified AGAIN and wrote in my review AGAIN I was only interested in speaking to a black woman. My search consisted of mostly MALES and white women, the exact opposite. Of the results only 2 were African American women and both of their schedules were very limited. This would not be an issue if I had the option to browse and filter based on my specified preference to find one that did. I even found a therapist online that worked with BetterHelp I was interested in working with, but when I clink the link to her profile on the app it redirects me back to the same search results. I’m extremely frustrated and offended and feel like this automated process is a waste of my time and was almost a waste of my money. Thank god I didn’t subscribe. Moving over to talk space instead.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"The theory is great, access to messaging a therapist whenever you want. I was struggling to find a local therapist I liked and thought this would be a good way to get me through a tough period of loss while continuing my local search. I didn’t have high expectations but figured it would be better than nothing, and being able to message someone when the feels were too much instead of waiting until a pre scheduled appointment sounded great. However the good marketing was not worth the money at all and it ended up feeling like I just threw several hundred dollars away. Matching took the full few days both times, both therapists I was matched with made me feel like I was talking at someone instead of having a productive conversation that was helping me work through things, and one therapist left the program while still assigned to me. I can not NOT recommend this enough. Go through the effort to find a local therapist that works for you.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"For me, this is what my experience looked like:

- friend suggested trying this app and said she’s loved it
- I signed up on a Thursday and was hoping to have someone to talk me through some things by Saturday. 
- The therapist I got matched with said she is taking weekends off for her mental health (understandable but frustrating) so I hoped to get a reply by Monday. Still nothing. 
- I tried switching therapists, but the app is not user friendly and I couldn’t figure out how to switch ANYWHERE on the app. 
- I decided to cancel and ask for a refund after reaching out to customer service through their email and not hearing back. 
- I found their number online by some miracle and when I called, they said they were an answering service and could take a message... I asked if they had a customer service department and she gave me another number. 
- Called that number and asked for a refund. She asked a bunch of questions like the last four of my cards and the expiration but said someone ELSE would be emailing me about canceling. 

At this point I think this app has just grown too quickly without doing the work on the backend to make it a good user experience. They need better customer service training and a more intuitive app layout. 

Assuming most people signing up have mental health issues, it’s not the greatest combination to have a frustrating experience with a therapy app.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I’ve tried Betterhelp for a month but did not feel as if my counselor was particularly helpful, and was also billed a week early for the next months renewal (it took over a week to match with my first counselor and my subscription started before I was matched rather than after the match, as their policy states). I brought up the billing issue when trying to cancel my subscription, and I was persuaded to try another month with a different counselor and promised 2 free weeks to accommodate for the previous billing issue as well as the counselor change. I was given an August 14 renewal date explicitly and I agreed to try for another month, but was billed two days before my old renewal date, on July 23 without the free weeks! The result is that I’ve had 7 weekly sessions while being billed for 3 months already! Definitely frustrated with their questionable methods to prevent people from cancelling subscriptions and not following through on correcting billing issues.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"In my experience, it felt like Uber for people who got a psychology degree. An opportunity for them to make some extra cash, but I wouldn’t recommend it if you’re trying to find someone experienced that can actually help you with anything deeper than daily life stress. I spent $790 while trying three different counselors during a pandemic when I lost my jobs. 

I don’t like that they only give you a few choices of counselors the first time and when you try to change it they give you another few to pick from. You end up wasting money while trying to find someone that works which is so discouraging when you’re trying to get help and you don’t have the mental capacity to keep digging and digging and it’s already so hard to reach out. 

The concept is cool and I’m sure it’s helped others. I just didn’t get lucky and couldn’t afford to keep trying.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"This app is way too expensive for unreliable counselors. First I was match with a counselor who had zero availability for a live video sessions and he hardly responded to any of my messages. That I was match with another counselor which I only had a 20 minute live session with which strictly consisted of her talking about herself and the relationship she had with her children,Then she messaged me and told me that she couldn’t meet with me anymore and then never responded afterwards. Then finally I was matched with a great counselor whom I worked through a lot with but then with no notice changed her availability, which we had discussed at the beginning of our sessions to times it absolutely would not work with my work schedule. I already have issues with abandonment and frankly these counselors it made it worse. If you’re looking for good consistent long term counseling I would not recommend this app.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I’m going this app 2 stars. Not because of the app but because of the company model. The therapists are mostly part time and don’t have enough time and/or training to adequently take care of their patients. Leading to patients feeling alone, vulnerable, and in worse conditions. My therapist forgot who I was and forgot we had met. The second therapist I had never picked up the calls and in a month barely would respond to my messages. My sister’s therapist took her session at her son’s little league game and was eating during it. I had another friend who’s therapist feel asleep on the call. I don’t blame the therapists fully but I blame the model they are put in to over book themselves and ultimately not having a good client roster cause they need the extra cash. This isn’t helpful and can have negative effects on the consumers who are struggling.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I feel the the ‘therapists’ on this platform are either recent grads or low rated counselors who couldn’t attract real life clients. I was constantly cancelled on, often hours before my appointment, and when I tried to schedule (or usually reschedule) I found most therapists only offered morning or late afternoon appointments, which don’t work for people who have 9-5 jobs. If there was more availability around lunch hours/weekends/evenings I would have been willing to try again, but there was just no flexibility, which I thought was the purpose of the platform.

I was also disappointed I was paired with therapists who ONLY offered chat. Better Help says they offer live calls and video sessions, but never clarifies that not all their counselors offer all methods of communication. Chat therapy just doesn’t work for me, and I don’t think it’s fair to charge everyone the same amount of money if they don’t have access too all the communication methods.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I’m really disappointed because I really thought I had found something wonderful and amazing! After about a week of getting to know my counselor, and reading what the other recommended counselor said, I am convinced this place pays for their positive feedback & reviews. There’s just no way. I was shocked by the treatment of both counselors, Jennifer Wickman and Alice Hamil said to me and how they dealt with my very sensitive & fragile state of mind. Also, I believe they don’t follow the privacy act, and the client/therapist rule of discretion, because the new therapist knew about things that I had only revealed to the first one, so I believe they communicate amongst each other without respecting the doctor/patient confidentiality agreement. Not cool! So I’m out. Just be careful with what you say. In your journals too! They make you write in your journal every day, but I started feeling like others were reading my private journal entries so I felt really uneasy about that as well.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"The app doesn’t deliver on its promises.
One counselor had a very busy schedule, I couldn’t find more than one slot with him for a given week. As a working professional it’s sometimes not enough to have one slot to choose from.
I tried asking to have my recurring time (so that I have a session let’s say every Tuesday, same time, convenient for him). Nope, the recurring sessions aren’t an option. Each week it was unpredictable when I’ll get a chance to speak to my counselor. (Exactly what you need when you try to bring more structure and order into your life.)
This one never really engaged into messaging between the sessions and never checked in on me.

Another counselor had more slots, wonderful. Though she bever really checked in on me. And after she overshared ABOUT HER problems, I thought it’s not going to work and I switched.

The next counselor did have availability, checked in on me periodically (which was great), but never replied to my messages!!! (So what’s the point of checking in then?)

Seriously, why can’t I have a __professional__ professional counselor (all-in-one pack)? Knows the theory, practiced before, does weekly follow ups, responds (one time per week would be enough, but just a meaningful not a template!!! answer)",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,WOW!!! All I can say is thank you to every single one of you who wrote an honest review and I want you to know that I’m truly sorry for what you had to experience but I also want you to know that sharing your experience has done for me personally and I’m sure 100’s if not 1000’s of others.  You have saved me from going through the horrific nightmare that you all have had to endure and I’m forever grateful to you.  It enrages me that you’ve all been put through this when all you were looking for was help.  Karma is a real thing and although it doesn’t fix what happened to you please know that what comes around goes around and this company and the others just like them will fail miserably and I’m hoping that those that have a solid case take this misleading conduct to the next level and hit them where it hurts.   I can’t imagine there not being many lawsuits in the making here.,betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I joined BetterHelp because I was feeling depressed and initially it was great. But over time what happened was that scheduling an appointment would take up to a month. Then when I’d meet with my counselor, if I didn’t feel bad she’d prod until I came up with something to be upset with. Essentially the pressure to schedule sessions (because the app is so expensive) caused me to focus on my problems so that I had something to discuss. Which over time, made me more depressed! So be careful!

If you have money to burn I’d say this is a worthwhile app. But if $260 a month seems like a lot of money to you just go to regular counseling. In the long run actual counseling is much cheaper and getting appointments is the same hassle. Plus with live therapy you pay per session instead of through a subscription. And due to covid most therapists do video sessions so there doesn’t seem to be any benefit to using BetterHelp over regular therapy.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I have thoroughly enjoyed being able to talk with my counselor on my own schedule. But the app is difficult when it comes to scheduling. There have been multiple issues for updating when appointments are on my counselors end which had resulted in a waste of my time waiting for them to log on but them not be available. It also does not allow you to schedule more than one appointment at a time or even see availability last your currently scheduled one. And if a session is supposed to be happening, you can't do anything except use the chat feature. It's frustrating and has caused a loss of my time and value. I've had 4 incidents in the last two months that have had these issues. I wish there was also a feature to sync the schedule to google calendar or outlook or something.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I’ve never had counseling before and I thought especially during the pandemic this would be a good way to dip my toes in. For the first couple of weeks it helped tremendously, mainly just having a neutral party to vent to and the groupinars were extremely helpful. After a couple weeks my counselor would randomly cancel my appointment without notice and reschedule it for another day. This happened several times until finally I decided to switch and see if another counselor would be a better fit. My next two counselors both did the same thing, and the bummer is that you’re charged for your session ahead of time, and if you’re cancelled on there is no reimbursement. Tbh it felt like after the first month they decided that they were already getting my money so why try 🤷🏻‍♀️ I would say if you want to try it choose the pay by the week plan juuuust in case.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"After having only 1 session and scheduled for another one the following week, the app stopped working, right when I was to start my second session. Other than through the App, there is no way to contact your therapist to tell them you are late. I missed my scheduled session because the app stopped working at a critical time. There is no phone number to call to get technical help. The only  number provided to help you is the suicide prevention hotline. You have to email them and they will contact you within 24 hours. I contacted better help to help get help in my technical issue and the solution was to do things I already did like uninstall and reinstall the app and update my phone. Done and problem still persists. I can’t log in. Unfortunately this was the help my company provided and I can’t get the help needed. My complaint will go to my company now.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Had a terrible experience. Used the service for 2 months. Each one of my weekly sessions (8 of them) had at least one instance of a connectivity issue, whether it be poor audio or the call just ending altogether. The first one was so bad that the therapist suggested we just continue the session via text message. My final session, the call dropped out three times and for most of the session the therapist’s voice was inaudible. I’ve never had an issue using zoom for voice and video chats, and I was only using the voice call feature on this app so I’m not sure why the audio was so terrible.  Also, repeated messages to customer support were unanswered. This led me to canceling my membership. Save your money and find a service that actually cares.  My money is very tight and I tried to make an investment in myself but I was essentially just fleeced for over $500.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Huge rip off! I spent 240 something a month for nothing! When I made the profile it asked how I would like to do my sessions and I said video call, so when my “therapist “ asked how I’d like to do my sessions every week I felt uncomfortable telling her video call because I felt like she was pushing me to do texting. After like week 3 I legitimately couldn’t make a session so she asked if she could text that night which was fine but she took that as permission to text every session. She never asked again what type of session I preferred but after the sessions we did have I didn’t feel like I was ever being listened too in the first place . “We’ll what type of problems are u having?” “Well my uncle just died for starters and I ..” “ oh that’s great have you thought about cleaning your room?” Don’t spend money on this app go to a real therapist or a boxing gym you will never find help here.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I’ve been using this app for almost 9 months now, I used to rave about it to anyone who would listen! Then, I decided I needed a bit more of a challenge from a counselor and wanted to try a new person. This new person was a horrible counselor and told me I have too much trauma to work on anything but trauma. I’d been doing trauma work the past 8 months, and wanted a change. She made me feel like I don’t know what I want. She told me she didn’t want to work with me. It was upsetting. I complained about the experience and emailed them saying I want to cancel. As of right now they won’t cancel my account unless I redownload the app? They’re acting like I can’t cancel my account through them? I’m so disappointed to be getting the run around when this is supposed to be an app supporting your mental health. I feel totally judged and taken advantage of. What a bad experience!",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Horrible beyond measure. I had to go through a parade of absolutely laughable “therapists” before I finally got the message and cancelled my subscription. I spent at least half hour writing a heart felt message to one, and received a reply that probably took 30 seconds to write. Another one copied and pasted a reply into our chat after I told her of one of the problems I was dealing with. Like she had a “file” of preloaded responses for each condition. So disrespectful. Another one told me to join a support group for my addiction and then “get back to her after having a zoom call or two with them”...and she was supposedly an addiction specialist! What a disrespectful joke of a counselor. This app was an interesting experiment, but will NEVER be able to replace in-person therapy. There’s nothing like physically sitting across from the therapist as you discuss your issues...sorry BetterHelp, you failed.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"After using their service for a month, I decided not to renew. Apparently I didn’t follow all the steps to cancel and I was charged $156. After emailing them to get a refund the day of because you can’t get in touch with anyone over the phone. I was emailed back saying that I qualified for a financial scholarship which I did not ask for. I specifically told them I DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY I was charged for in my account and that I want a refund because now I am stressed about it and that I want a full refund.  So instead of just giving me a refund of the money that I don’t have. She gives me a partial refund of $46 because she decided that my problem was that I couldn’t afford  to pay the whole bill. Does this sound like people who want to help you or just take your money? Thanks a lot BetterHelp for screwing up my bank account",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Nothing? After 2 counselors and 2 months of sessions, I think I would have preferred nothing. It may be the luck of the draw, but the two counselors I worked with weren’t helpful. The first took more of a life-coaching tack and began insistently telling me what I should do half way through the first session. With the second counselor, I felt like I was constantly re-explaining my situation, and these sessions unsurprisingly did not lead to much progress with my concerns. 

I’ve been fortunate to talk with effective counselors in the past, and the BetterHelp interactions were nowhere close to being as helpful as those previous experiences. I recently switched to a more traditional therapist, and the difference is night and day; so far, this new therapist has been much more supportive and empathetic, fostering deeper engagement that led to greater progress in a single session than all of the BetterHelp sessions combined.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"My wife has been having having therapy sessions with Sharon Simmons now for a little over a month. I recently found out my wife was committing infidelity with a co worker. Shorty after she wanted to move out and figure things out and probably get a divorce. I told my wife that’s fine if you want to take some space to figure things out. But please, break things off with this other man while you make this big decision. She says “ok I’ll ask my therapist” then messaged Sharon Simmons “is it a fair request to break things off with this man I’m committing infidelity with while moving out from my husbands house and deciding if I still want to get a divorce?” Sharon responds with “ I think it's okay to still talk to the guy but keep your focus on healing. Sounds like you're moving forward and that's good.” As far as I'm aware the Sharon Simmons did not recommend couples counseling.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"The interface is so bad.  I hate that you have to be in the session in order for the therapist to call you.  I also feel like the therapists need better tech training with how to use the interface because I’ve experienced a lot of therapists being 10-15 minutes late due to “tech difficulties” but it shouldn’t be that hard.  Also 10-15 minutes is literally 1/3 of my session that I am paying for!  Often times my therapist would be driving or doing other work during our sessions which I feel like is unfair and divides their attention.  I tried 3 therapists and none of them actually replied or even read my text or audio messages.  If the therapist is allowed to completely ignore texts and audio messages, stop advertising your services as 24/7 audio message & text!",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"My counselor was pretty checked out and it often felt like she was trying to pawn me off to someone else. I would mention one tiny workplace problem and her response was “I could refer you to someone who specializes in workplace anxiety” without even trying to really help me.

Other reviewers have said counselors are swamped and don’t really have time to focus on you and that’s 100% true. My counselor often cut our sessions (which were supposed to be an hour) down to 30-40 minutes, and gave me contradictory advice week to week. She never seemed to remember what we talked about the week before.

The ads say you can switch counselors at any time but after trying for awhile to do that and not being able to figure it out, I just cancelled my service. By the end of it I felt worse than when I signed up.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,I though it would be a good idea to get this app to ease myself into therapy without the pressure of being face to face with someone. My therapist didn’t respond to me at all unless I was messaging her within her scheduled time to meet with me. I didn’t enjoy the few sessions that I had with her because she was taking up all this time asking me questions about my life and family when I came to her with one issue that I wanted to resolve. I felt like after a few hour long sessions we still hadn’t even talked about what I needed help with. I also felt that she was biased in her conversations with me when I was discussing family issues with her. She wasn’t listening to my side of the story and then judged what I was doing with my life and what my future plans were. I am sure there are great therapists on this app but I just got a bad one.,betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Had one bad therapist after another on this app. The first one was very condescend and made me feel worse about myself. The second one said she couldn’t send any messages because she had injured fingers, which to me was a no because I need someone that can be responsive to my messages. And the third and final straw was when my therapist responded to my messages once a week and had no live session availability for 3 weeks out (she only did Monday's and Tuesday's of live sessions). When I asked her if she could fit me in sooner because I really needed someone to talk to she told me that the times I saw were what she had and she couldn’t talk to me sooner. Completely ridiculous that I’d pay for a month subscription and get one session 3 weeks out.....I feel like I was totally scammed by BetterHelp and would never recommend this service to anyone.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Both my SO and I have been using this for a couple months to work on individual areas and regainus (the couples version). We’ve both been bounced around multiple times. It seems like they, like everyone, are having a hard time keeping staff. The counselors are in way over their heads. Most are 20 something’s with very little real life experience. One was bragging about 5 years “in the field.”  Scheduling is simple if you can get your counselors to commit. I’ve had sessions rescheduled multiple times. 

On a plus side… the three counselors I’ve personally spoken to seem nice enough.  The technology also works well. Obviously a benefit that sessions can be anywhere any time. 

Don’t get me wrong… it’s a value price so you get what you pay for. It also seems like the counselors are trained to keep clients coming back…",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,I could not be more disappointed with the services I’ve gotten from this app. My first therapist showed up late hung up the phone while I was talking to her and when I messaged her after she hung up while it was still our time for our appointment it took her hours to respond. Then when I went to look for another therapist who had live sessions I was only able to find one on the list. The one I found when I schedule a session to one of the timeslots that she has open instead of messaging me asking me another time I’m free she just change my slot. I’ve never given her my availability so there’s no reason for her to think I’m open at that time. Also when I talk to her all she does is say OK. If I wanted to vent I would just do it to one of my friends for free I’m not paying for someone to vent to. Not worth it!,betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I tried this app. I heard so many good things from YouTubers, friends, etc. My first counselor I got paired with was aloof, cold, and disconnected. I quickly found that she was not a good match for me and switched therapists.

My second and final therapist was a disaster. Our second session, I was annoyed that she was talking way, way more than me (25 minutes in, I had spoken for TWO minutes). I ended up hanging up on her AFTER SHE WENT THROUGH A DRIVE THRU DURING OUR SESSION. I was appalled. I felt so disrespected which is the last thing anybody should feel during therapy.

For a reduced price rate of $208 a month, BetterHelp is entirely too expensive for what it is. I recommend searching for a therapist in your area and if cost is an issue, inquire about a sliding scale or pro bono work. I know from a firsthand experience that therapy can be life changing, I would just not recommend  BetterHelp.

The only reason I gave two stars is because BetterHelp did reach out to me after I reported my experience and offered a free week of therapy so I could connect to a counselor (not enough compensation in my opinion) and because I do have some friends that love BetterHelp and have found amazing therapists.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I went to the app to start my first session, and the app didn’t work (“internal server error”). I finally found a phone number online, called, and the person I spoke with told me he would pass my concerns on to the customer success team and they would email me within 24 hours. Not sure why they even have someone to answer the phones if they just write down your question and have someone else email you about it a day later. I’ve now missed my appointment after waiting almost 2 weeks for it, and I’m now 3/4 weeks through my first month that cost me over $200 and I haven’t even spoken to a counselor.

If you are looking for counseling to improve your patience or address anger issues, BetterHelp will probably make them worse with their embarrassingly lacking customer service.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Therapy overall was fine; however, the customer service contact options are horrible. There is no phone number listed in the app - you have to fill out a form to request contact. I’ve submitted 3 requests over the span of 3 weeks & never heard from anyone. I had to Google a number to call. Once I was finally able to speak to someone, all they did was collect my information and submitted a request for someone to contact me. I was told I’d hear from someone in 1 business day, but 3 days came and went. I called the number again, just to have my information submitted into a portal for someone to contact me back. There are so many people looking for jobs, Betterhelp, please get some employees. I’ve spent over $1,000 with this company and cannot get basic needs met… smh",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"The app works fine it’s the behind the scenes that is completely off at BetterHelp. I think it’s because the therapists are independent contractors and yes they ask you and ask you if the therapist is doing a great/good job, you can switch pretty easily if you do t like your therapist. God forbid you have a question about the different levels of subscriptions. I have asked at least 4 times and instead of the person assigned to me in customer services asking a manager to respond I’m either getting my answer half-a$$ed answered or just not answered at all. It is so frustrating I’m cancelling my subscription. Their customer service is adding stress to my life and I’m having to talk to my BetterHelp therapist about it. That’s ridiculous.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I had a lot of trouble matching to a counselor who would be a good fit for me - I specifically asked for someone without a religious lens and was first matched with a therapist who mentioned prayer and god in the bio, so I changed counselors. The next one sent me a couple brief canned queries and was then unavailable for a couple weeks - which is cool, because we all need a break - and subsequently was still very difficult to schedule conversations with except at the last minute. I thought about going for a third different counselor but also felt resentful that this was making my life harder instead of better. I really needed help and was charged for four weeks of therapy to receive none. Other folks seem to have had better experience, so maybe I just fell through the cracks here.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"You have to pay for 4 weeks of therapy upfront regardless of if they match you with a therapist or if that therapist’s availability fits your schedule. I didn’t receive any therapy sessions in my first week which I paid for and won’t receive credit for.  I was able to schedule a session in my second week and my first intake appointment, the first time the therapist ever met me, was less than half an hour.  How do you get to know someone and show them that you care in less than 30 minutes? (You can’t). She was late to our session and then ended it abruptly at the 30 minute mark without offering anything helpful to me.  She was emotionally unavailable for me, forgot about things I had just told her, and apologized that her brain was “fried” because it was late in her time zone.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I can’t speak for everyone, but personally, I had a bad experience and it was a waste of money. I signed up, filled out all of my info, and requested a CA psychologist. They assigned me to someone from Alabama. Not a huge deal, but took me a few days to transfer over and find a new one. I finally get someone in my area, and had to wait a week for an appointment. He comes in to the zoom meeting 15 minutes late, for a 45 min session. I go to schedule a follow up appointment, but the next availability is 2.5 weeks down the line (I wanted a follow up a few days later). I finally have my follow up meeting, but he has to re-schedule. It was the biggest waste of $250 or whatever it cost. Stay away from this company. I have had therapy before, this one just felt cheap and low quality.",betterhelp-therapy,,,

2,Been on here for about a month and so far I have spent nearly 400 dollars for 2 text messages from my therapist. At this rate it’s going to cost me tens of thousands of dollars to work through my issues. They really need a pricing model that includes text only subscriptions for those of us who can’t effectively communicate our feelings in real time. Basically you’re paying for an hour long session every week regardless of whether you schedule one. Also I’ll add that I just started therapy because it was free. I never really had anxiety before but after a year of this I’m riddled with constant and anxiety and self doubt from all the issues that got brought up during therapy. BetterHelp has broken my brain.,betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,I would have the app open and ready for the phone call live session but would receive a message from my counselor that I appeared offline. This happened the first time but were were able to eventually connect and have a 20 minute conversation until we lost connection. Rescheduled a week later and I made sure my WIFI was fully connected and waited with the app opened. She told me I was offline and I tried to restart the app but then it wouldn’t load for a few minutes. I asked her if I appeared online now but she never responded. I tried to restart again and then the app wouldn’t load at all. I was very excited to start this process but I was so frustrated that I canceled my subscription,betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"First therapist admitted outright they had no expertise with adhd. That’s fine. Thanks for being honest. Same therapist then Talked Over me when I tried to explain moving meditation and said that sitting meditation hasn’t worked for me.
Even worse the therapist suggested I make my animal an ESA so I can fly with them in the airplane cabin. That felt highly irresponsible to me as 1) they couldn’t know yet if I even need an ESA (first session). 2) they asked nothing about my pet. Said animal would increase my anxiety because they are Noisy when traveling. 3) Untrained ESAs increase the stigma against service animals because they act so unpredictably. 

Could I have tried to get matched with a new therapist? Sure. But if I’m going to have to bounce between therapists for a while I’d rather do it with therapists my insurance covers.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"My experience with Better Help was that I’d try to connect with the therapist in their app, and…. Static. Try reconnecting, and… static. Tried a direct phone call instead of through the app, which did actually connect for about 20 minutes and then failed. Attempted a video chat, and that froze up. Repeated processes with no success. Mind you, this was done with 4 of 5 bars of phone service, and a 1gbs fiber optic internet connection, there was no problem with service.

So, you will be charged an entire months worth at bare minimum for a service you will not be able to use. Maybe not a scam, but I paid for a service that due their cheapness of server provider (or whatever is the actual cause) can not use, and I lost $360.

This isn’t better help. They’re better thief’s.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,I did better help for a while and they used to give 60% off to me in “financial aid” but now they don’t do that. They say they are cheaper then regular therapy but there not if you have insurance and they don’t take insurance. I’m glad they give access to therapy to some people but most people who need it can’t afford 260$ a month. The therapist I had was also incompetent. She spoke about other clients and I ultimately ended things with her because she judged me. Another therapist I felt unhelpful to. I have I guess a high standard for who I talk to as I’ve been to therapy a long time. They need more quality checks on people or something. I hope someday they accept insurance or give help to low income people. Because that’s really what people need.,betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I signed up for BetterHelp as a way to continue therapy after in person visits have been stopped due to covid19. My therapist doesn’t do video chats so I decided to try this out. The counselor I was matched with was okay over text but once we video chatted, I felt no different than I had before the call. I don’t know if it’s a privacy issue but she only showed an eyeball when we were talking. It’s hard to want to talk to someone when it’s that awkward. Based off that and some of our communication, I decided to switch counselors. It kept asking me to write more about myself and 3 days went by before they said they couldn’t match me to anyone. AWESOME. They immediately kicked me off the app with barely any notice. I’ll miss the webinars the most. Such a waste of time but at least they refunded me immediately.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"They charge you by the week, not the month. Base pay is $65 a week. Why would you pay for something every week when realistically and ideally you’re not using their services every week? They’re just preying on the mentally ill. Good luck getting therapist, it takes a minimum of 24 hours but can very easily take longer. I just signed up under the misconception that they’d charge you only if you had a therapy session every week, not charge for the week even if you didn’t use their services. I can’t afford to pay $65 every week, I barely work BECAUSE of my mental health. I don’t have that kind of cash flow so I have no choice but to cancel my subscription before I even get to use it. So “thanks” BetterHelp, you really did me a lot of good.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"The apps idea is great but the execution is so poor, I’ll basically categorize it as the definition of clickbait. The prize per week it’s not as bad however one isn’t able to pay weekly instead you have to pay for the entire month in order to even get to use the app. Because of how much help I need I decided trying the app for the entire month that it forces you to pay. So far I spent about a week just trying to get match with a therapist and every time I have had to go for find new therapist because once I’m match the therapists won’t reply; which makes the 24/7 service questionable. In conclusion, if you are part of the working class I don’t recommend the app as the amount of money that is pay in comparison with service is not worth it.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"So first off the app is glitchy as heck and will get stuck on a single page, but on several different pages this will happen. The only way to get out is to close the app all together, and there appears to be no rhyme or reason to the issues. The platform is not at all intuitive, and will also send you a million notifications via app, text, and email, even after you opt out. 

Now for the actual therapy - I can’t comment on this because my first therapist rescheduled so many times that it caused me to switch, and then the next therapist had no experience in the issues I needed help with, so I cancelled my account. 

There’s a shortage of therapists in the US but this does not even come close to bridging the gap.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"This app charges you per week, even before finding you a therapist. Instead of charging once you are paired with someone: it charges for delays and incompetence. So you’re paying for no service at all. Once they paired me with a therapist; that therapist did their appointment with me while riding around in a car with her friend. I should sue BetterHelp for all of my money back. They billed my HSA, so if they aren’t following the law and are billing weeks before they actually provide service- than it should fall under medical fraud. I asked the therapist (after I noticed a seat belt) if she was driving. She responded, “No”. So someone else is driving you? “Yes, my friend.” I had had it immediately with Better Help. Better Help should reimburse all of my tax-free money.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I’m happy for BH bringing me to my therapist, she’s amazing and actually provides me with homework, tools, and enlightenment. Our sessions aren’t just chats, they are work and I’ve never felt better. 

However, I can’t justify paying $140/month for ONE session a month. This was after I was paying $230/month for unlimited sessions (and that was a discounted price btw) which I found pointless cos my tolerance for sitting and talking and going through my trauma more than once a week is zero. I was drained trying to justify the price point.

Anyway, I would only recommend this app to find your therapist, get to know them, then ask if they take on private clients for more than half the cost.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I am going to stop using this service. My counselor has cancelled about half of the sessions I've scheduled. ( 4/8) It's definitely hard to build any kind of trust when they are simply unreliable. Also, if I am being honest, I have heard from others that their therapists on better help cancelled all the time on them as well. It does seem like maybe this app is a bit of a scam. Promising 1 session a week, the counselors double book and cancel often,  so I’m only getting about 2 sessions a month. That means I’m paying double the advertised price per session. Also, the availability is poor, so a counselor often won’t have a single opening in a week. I think this company is taking advantage of people who are genuinely trying to get help.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"If you have insurance in the US therapy is whatever your specialist copay is… for me that’s $40 a session. Most therapists will book you weekly or every other week for a 50 minute session, on the same day at the same time…. So it would cost about $160 a month.

This is $270 a month. The sessions are 30 minutes, and it’s not possible to book more than one at a time, so I’ve been constantly scrambling to fit therapy into my life.

The only thing good about it is that you don’t have to find your own therapist and you can probably get your FIRST session in the next few days, but after that you’ll be waiting every two weeks for sure.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Thinking about trying a 1 month trial? I was really excited and interested until I was continually losing days until my entire 50% off (still paid $180) trial was practically gone. First a couple of days to be assigned a counselor, then a few days to make contact, then a couple of days to fill out this form, then a couple of days to fill out that form with zero acknowledgement regarding my efforts. Days slipped by as the counselor I was assigned really didn’t care and continually sent generic messages with no sense of humanity. Also, I was assigned to a social worker who clearly does BetterHelp on the side and was only available on the weekends.  $180 to be led on and beat down.  Never again, and I will never recommend this service to anybody.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"My assigned therapist took advantage of my trust. They told me about another patient to have me recommend solutions to their problems, they included the other patient’s name and personal details in direct violation to patient confidentiality. This did not bother me much at first until I realized they were taking up most of my sessions doing that. Eventually I felt entirely pointless, taken advantage of, and was paying to be used. This was a huge violation of my trust and very damaging to my mental health. Update: Currently the only support or contact with Betterhelp has been for them to pass me off to TECH SUPPORT and pretend there was a software issue. This is disgusting and anyone should be wary using this service.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"All I learned from using BetterHelp is that I am an absolute fool to have spent $320 on this. The therapists are extremely under-qualified for dealing with mental health, and I can only see this being helpful to people with extremely mild and treatable anxiety. Any other mental health concern, you will leave feeling totally alone and hopeless. My therapist prompted me to talk about my traumas, then responded extremely inappropriately with a text about her religion and how a holy day is coming up to bring light to my life. (I did not list religion in my profile, so this was totally uncalled for and unprofessional). Most of the responses look like they were copy and pasted and sent to every client. Did not feel listened to at all. If anything this app actually spiraled me into more of a depression.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,I was SO HOPEFUL and excited when I signed up for this app. My first counselor had an excellent bio. I was excited. She never got back to me ever. When I asked for some kind of “work” to do til our session she gives me 2 work sheets with no explanation whatsoever. Changed my counselor. He sounded great also. Excited again. Although he did get back to me he just kept telling me to pray when I very clearly told him I pray all day everyday. Changed counselor AGAIN. After telling her I needed help with anxious thoughts consuming me she offers me help finding a new job (my job being one of the things that makes me anxious). I told her I don’t need help finding a new job I need help with anxiety. She literally never got back to me after that. Cancelled app. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!!,betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"Why are we billed weekly or monthly? Sometimes therapists have no time available a given week… but you still pay. And since you can’t book more than one session in advance, you always run into the same problem. Or if you go on vacation and can’t see someone a given week… you still pay!
This is pretty expensive, so this problem is very frustrating. Instead, I would like them to offer “packs”: instead of billing for a month, bill for 4 live sessions which are only counted if you actually do them.
(Let’s be honest the “unlimited texts and emails” is silly, you only text your therapist to schedule a session)",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I’ve been working with Better Help since the beginning of the year, and I’ve made no progress. I’ve been in therapy before, so I know what a good connection with a therapist should feel like. It is hard to build trust with a therapist in this format. I like routine, so the inability to pick the same time each week disrupts my momentum. Worst of all, one therapist failed to show up to a session twice, so I switched to another one. The second therapist was having technical difficulties tonight, so she sent an apologetic message. I appreciate the communication, but why am I paying for people to not show up? They’re good people, but it’s not working for me. It may be worse than nothing.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Paid for a week. I got a counselor that had no time for me. Literally, the day I had off 5 days later she was booked! Why pair me with someone booked out multiple weeks when I paid for just one? Not only that, but I listed my concerns as financial, and before my counselor and I even began to chat, literally 3 instant messages in, she tells me I need to allocate more money to counseling. Oh, so the week I paid for is worthless? I chose to decline further help, but the app keeps auto pairing me with new people which is just stressful. I want it to stop completely. Just take the money I spent, I know I’ve been with you for less than 24 hours but it’s clear there is serious issues and I don’t want to be taken advantage of any more.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"i tried to use this app for a couple months before i realized its not for mentally ill people. first therapist canceled our appointment last minute without saying why or rescheduling. second one didn’t have availability. a couple more were religious & not lgbtq+, when i specifically requested the opposite. they say it takes 24-48 hours to match with a counselor and this is a lie. it’s taken me 3+ days to find a match each time. worst part is they charge you $400/month for this “service.” it’s crap, don’t fall for it. i did have one therapist i saw a few times but i didn’t get anything out of it. she basically just would say “oh that’s awful” or tell me to just think about my problems differently which… if you have a serious mental illness that just increases the sense of guilt and shame. if you are lonely and just stressed this is probably a decent app but if you are actually mentally ill i wouldn’t recommend it at all. they also make it seem like it’s easy to be matched with an lgbtq+ counselor but i tried half a dozen time and never found one.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Charged up front for full month subscription, not weekly. Went through 3 counselors in the first week because of scheduling conflicts. Finally got one, but you only get 30 min sessions. Week 2, I had a 30 minute session. You are lucky to get an actual session within a week from each other. My counselor was late on the last two sessions, which were 2 weeks apart. Once 20 mins late (week 3) and the last one (week 4) she messaged me 30 mins late saying she wasn't notified I was online. For the counselor to initiate the call you have to be on the chat screen. So I sat there waiting and refreshing for 30 minutes. I paid $300+ plus for two 30 minute sessions in a month time. Wouldn’t recommend.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,Every time I got matched with a counselor their availability was very limited and I had to wait days weeks to hear back. Definitely was not worth the $250 when I was only able to get 2 counseling sessions in. Not to mention a lot of the counselors act more as just people to talk to rather than actual counsel and assistant you through your issues which defeats the purpose. I finally got a great counselor when I opted to cancel my subscription and even then I couldn’t get a chat session or live session or phone session until my 2nd to last week before my subscription was over. I rather try to find in person counseling at this point.,betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I had the program for about a year, near the end I didn’t receive real therapy(no advice) and had hired regular appointments with another therapist to deal with my anxiety.  Then tried it again and was abandoned by my therapist after a couple months by her cancelling all contact without notice.  She gave some lie about I had to be physically in that state when she talking to me. Very unprofessional.  She cancelled everything without notice.  Which is called patient abandonment.  She did during the pandemic. 

Why pay for therapy if I have to do all the work by learning dynamics of relationships. Isn’t that what a therapy is paid for?  To help me stand up against abuse and anxiety.

Not real therapy, I wasted my money.

They give me a therapist 30 years my junior who lacked empathy.  Image a therapist who that lacks empathy.   Who really couldn’t connect with me about my life nor did she care.  Very little experience. The bare minimum of programs requiresments.  Seems most are the same, therapist who lacks life experiences to give you empathy.  Try in person appointments you gain more. Be good to yourself with a real appointment. You deserve better!!!",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"This app is a complete scam do NOT JOIN! I paid the money up front, was matched with a counselor , made my appointment and she never even showed up to our session. She never replied to one message, nothing.  I chose another counselor and her only available appointment was in 2 weeks!!  I emailed support demanding a refund and they sent a form letter trying to SELL me more weeks offering a free week and another counselor?? I have anxiety and THIS is supposed to help me? This experience has given me MORE anxiety! They don’t care about anyone they are serving and the FORM email from customer service is proof. Do they even vet out their counselors? I am so upset, it took a lot for me to look for help and another door was slammed in my face, with no one to help me.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I am sad to write that my therapist stopped showing up after 2 sessions. On my third one she just disappeared. I am so disappointed in this app. It should have gone like this. I have never in my life been stood up by someone with a professional license with no explanation as to why. It’s been a few days, I have reached out to BetterHelp and gotten no response. If you open your heart to a therapist and they just don’t even show up and you have to find a new one, that’s just not ok. Some people can’t open up more than once or to all these new people all the time. It takes a lot just to do it once. I can find better in person. I deserve to be treated better.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I was matched to two different counselor. The first was a very abrasive woman told me to quote, “just stop feeling this way.” 
The second counselor, when she found out that I was visiting my parents out of state told me she couldn’t speak with until I returned to my residential state. While I understand the legality involved, she completely dropped me during a very stressful and unstable time in my life without any advice or help to find another counselor. I had sent her a series of messages outside of business hours that were marked urgent and didn’t hear from her until four days later. I’m not saying there aren’t good and helpful counselors through this service. Just be wary. These women did not have my best interest in mind.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Signed up, their only option was monthly, so paid. The first week they “matched” me with counselors that didn’t meet the basic questionnaire I filled out (two were religious when I specifically said no religion, one didn’t do video chats when I specifically said video chats), so then I had 3 weeks after paying for 4. Then, I only had a half hour session, the next week was maybe 10 minutes and the last maybe 5 minutes. I was expecting some sort of counseling, rather then “how was your week? Ok? Well, call me next week.” This is not counseling service, they just take 2 months (I was renewed before the last 5min session) of cash for about 45 minutes of small talk.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I had to keep switching therapists because sometimes they will not show up to sessions without a word about them not being able to make it. A few therapists that I’ve had the displeasure of matching with are comically bad. I had a lady that would just talk on end for minutes that had me questioning if I was I there for therapy or was she. It was so strange. The group sessions proved to be unhelpful for me, some of the other group session attendees seem to love it though. Customer service was always great though, they would respond within 24-48hours and extended my subscription whenever something interfered with my sessions.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"1. The video chat feature is very buggy, making a video session with counselor more distracting annoying annoying than helpful.
2. While the words you type and the things you say are private from what I can tell, when you open the app, how long you’re in the app, how long sessions last are all available to companies like Facebook so they can target you with ads based on your mental health as they perceive by your data. 
3. They do not verify the qualifications of counselors. They state in their terms of service but you must perform independent verification.
4. This is basically Uber for therapy in a broken car and the driver may or may not have a suspended license.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I signed up last week to receive much needed counseling. I signed up for the $65 weekly plan. I had one session with my counselor, and I enjoyed it. She was very nice. Yesterday I changed my plan to the $45 weekly plan, and today I check my bank account and they charged me the yearly amount of $585. I tried to get in contact with customer service 4 times, and the only way you can get in touch with customer service is through email. And it takes one business day to respond. Also, I checked my bank statement, and they charged me with the highest rate of $80 a week instead of $65. BEWARE!! They will steal your money! It’s so unfortunate that a service establishes to help people is actually just stealing from them.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I signed up for a plan based on the ads that you could have text conversations with your therapist, thinking it would be a somewhat regularly available option.  Instead, you have to choose a provider and schedule a time where you can text them for an hour. The timings are hard to obtain, the wait period is long, and I don’t feel this is any way more convenient than an in person therapist.  I found a local therapist, got a video call for intake, and scheduled future appointments before I was able to speak with someone through this app.  It was wasted money and I think you’re better off going with a local option.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"There is no way to pause any kind of plan without paying 200 a week. They can obviously see you aren’t using the app and never notify you of any billing or reminder/check in.

For an app that prides itself on helping people struggling mentally - you would think there would be grace or a feature that doesn’t bill you for a month of thereapy you don’t use. Maybe there is a lot going on? Maybe they took a month away from their anxiety inducing devices? 

A real therapist would only bill you for the sessions and if you stopped responding they would request you get removed from their client list - but they wouldn’t bill you for 4 sessions every month.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I did not have a good experience with this app or my therapist. Little to no communication and lack of response in the session portion where you can message your therapist etc.

She would ask me to explain and then wouldn’t respond. 

During the first and only session (I have since cancelled my account and deleted the app) I discovered my therapist was not at all competent to deal with sexual trauma and completely invalidated my experience and honestly it was awful. If you’re needing more in-depth therapy instead of worksheets and surface level conversation, I do not recommend this app at all. Very disappointed with my experience as it has taken me years to seek help for this. Back to square one.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,I’ve been going through a lot of depression and anxiety this late year and I finally decided to give this app a try because I don’t have a way to go out and see one and for this whole week I haven’t been able to reach anybody and when I did it was two days later ... I’ve tried to get in touch with 7-8 different counselors and just no one is reaching out within a reasonable time and it’s making me feel worse than when I didn’t try to reach out for help in the first place. I had high hopes that I was going to get the help I really need but maybe I just one of the unlucky ones that couldn’t get the help they needed if that makes sense.,betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Perhaps it’s because I only stayed for three sessions, but I did not find anything helpful from this service. Aside from being $400 a month, my counselor was always late for our sessions and kept pushing me to look for work outside of my skill set, even though my reasons for counseling had nothing to do with my employment. It was very odd, like she was a school counselor wanting to focus on my work and never giving me the chance to go into detail on my actual problems. I definitely do not recommend. If you only have minor anxieties then this may be for you, but I feel I’ve been scammed. Please seek actual counseling if you need help, because this service is not it.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I’ve been having problems since I first tried using BetterHelp last month. I went through 4 counselors. One of them did not respond to me my messages after a few days. The next one told me she straight up could not help me with my specific issue. The third one actually seemed promising…and then BetterHelp randomly switched me to a fourth counselor, who immediately tried pressuring me into continuing services. This all took place within a week. I canceled services after and got a refund.

Just yesterday, I wanted to perhaps talk to someone on the customer support, because I could not find another similar service and I get some extra information. Upon logging in on the app, I was charged immediately for a month of service, when I didn’t even select anything.

Customer support is also awful. Contacting them through the app will only get you a generic bot response. 

Luckily I got a refund (second time.) Perhaps this was just a random occurrence that rarely happens, but it was terrible.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"What you get with BetterHelp is different than the App. I signed up a week ago and had a bumpy start getting matched with a therapist who met the criteria I requested. In fact, several criteria were ignored.  Wasted a week of the service I paid for. Strike  one. 

Then I got matched with  someone who met one of the criteria but not others. I go to open the app to send them a message and it just doesn’t work. Says I’m not connected. I update. I close and reopen. I do all the things. 

The app is trash. Hopefully the service gets better. For $250/month I certainly expect better. Cheaper than an in-person therapist but possibly not worth the headache.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I was having trouble finding a therapist in my area, so I turned to BetterHelp. The first therapist I had said the word “definitely” 57 times in our first session. Yes, I counted. 

The second therapist seemed alright for a little, until I cried during our fourth session and he absolutely could not handle it. He shuffled through his notes to find me a “resource”, and then SAID HE HAD TO GO EARLY AND HUNG UP. You could probably find someone who’s decent if you spend a long time looking and switching, but it will cost you. It was over $600 for me to be matched with two absolutely terrible practitioners.  Never again.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Nice idea, awful execution.  You’re forced to pony up — even though financial aid is available — before you will even be allowed to talk to a counselor, which is a really bad idea because serious counselors will offer a free consult to see if you are a fit first.  To make matters worse, using a link from the website of one of the therapists to get access to BetterHelp does not guarantee you will get that specific therapist, which means you’re not allowed to choose who you get to work with.  Both are major no-nos.

Try it if you’re desperate, but be forewarned: All they really want is your money and you will be disappointed by how impersonal the selection process is.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I would give this another try but it’s way too expensive. $230 a month and it takes at least 2 weeks to figure out if you’re compatible with a therapists. It takes about 2 days to find a new therapist then it takes anywhere from a 1-2 weeks to get a session with that therapist. So in 2 months all I did was change therapist, wait for an opening in their schedule and then realize we weren’t going to work. Which is fine if I’m not paying so much money trying to find the right person. I’ve paid nearly $500 and only had 2 30 min sessions and 1 cut short because we both agreed it wasn’t going to work out.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I like the option to talk to my therapist without going anywhere. It’s helped immensely. 

However, I think BetterHelp needs to fix their payment options to prevent therapy from being a privilege. The lowest option is $35/week, but you have to pay that all at once, which is ridiculous. It’s one of the most affordable options, but it’s so difficult for people to meet. 

BetterHelp, do BETTER. Give an option to actually pay the $35/week instead of all at once so people have access to mental health. Are you actually trying to HELP people, or are you just in it for the capital??",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I am so disappointed with BetterHelp. This company NEVER assigned me with a therapist after 5 days & deleted my account after contacting support about a refund. They took my $180 with NO service given. Generally you’re supposed to be matched with a therapist within 24 hours as their service states. 5 days later I haven’t received the counseling I paid for, a complete waste of subscription. They took my money with no services given! Literally got rid of my account now i’m $180 short and cannot receive the talk therapy I need. An absolute scam and disappointment. I’ve reported this issue to the Better Business Bureau as well. I regret not being weary of their services like everyone else after the immense backlash they received.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"Tried this out for a month and it seemed elementary. If you’re going through something like anxiety, depression, relationship problems, addiction, etc. you could just save your money and buy some books on these topics and you’ll learn just as much through those pages than you would with this online therapy method. This app is really just paying for a quick friend to listen to you. If that’s what you need, by all means go through with it. But if you’re seeking complex and detailed discussions with challenges and solutions to help you progress, I can’t see this being the go-to app.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"My mentor is great, but the platform has issues, and customer service is incredibly slow in todays market. If you have a billing or scheduling issue, you can only get it resolved by sending an email. It can take a few business days to hear back, and there’s a chance your problem does not get immediately solved, which means you start the emailing timelines all over again. I wish you call BetterHelp to talk through issues with app or platform, but they are keeping costs down and only allowing you to email them.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"In short, $288 for not even a full 30 minute session once a month and some text messages. You can get 2 one hours sessions a month with a lot of other therapists for that. Paired me with a social worker that was late for our first appt, which didn’t even last 30 mins, and she didn’t even show up for our second appt. The app only allows you to book 1 appt at a time so you’ll have to wait 2-3 weeks and then you’ll only get 1 appt a month because of that. Since your first session or so with any therapist is a wash anywhere you go, that means I spent $576 and got nothing out of it. Find someone local instead.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"Well, i've had to change this review. As of this writing, the app is no longer accessible. Even though they have done their best to implement accessibility into the website. I'm not sure what happened, but now it just reads as one big long screen and I can't tap anywhere to make it work. At all. The website on pc is similarly messed up. A perfect example of how you can build something and make it accessible according to guidelines, but is it usable to someone? Testing early and often. ... so, Hopefully my social media posts and emails will reach someone too.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"As someone who has had therapy many different times in my life, I know that sometimes you have to look for a therapist that is the right match for you. Which is why I was excited to have many counselors to choose from without having to do all the searching online myself. However, I tried three different counselors, and had some terrible experiences.
The straw that broke my back and pushed me to cancel was after finding a therapist that I liked, she completely no showed no called for one of our weekly appointments. I just think it’s so unprofessional to treat an appointment for someone who is in a fragile state of mind in that way.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I think I was only given one video chat throughout the month I was using the app. Half the time I wasn’t linked with a counselor, the other half they were too busy. I took advantage of the web seminars that they offered but as far as a one on one experience, it was a bit slow with responsiveness. To make up for unresponsiveness, I would just be given worksheets to fill out. Seems like my experience was the opposite of everyone else unfortunately. I don’t doubt that this works for some people but the part that gets me is the service that was offered isn’t what I got.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
2,"I’ve changed counselors on this app so many times, begged for help and insight but keep meeting unresponsive therapists. I can’t afford real therapy and needed help badly. Luckily I have supportive friends and family to be with me until I can find better help (ironic huh?) I wouldn’t recommend this app if you have mental issues that required more professional help. Not getting help when you’re asking for it makes it so much worse. It may be good for those with minor issues though. I wish it were easier to get real and consistent counseling, but until then I’m going to keep searching elsewhere.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,If I could give this app 0 STARS I would . I was physically refused assistance . Their excuse you ask “ You aren’t the right food t for online counseling “ HOW ???!!!  Do I have to be borderline suicidal or is it that my issue isn’t so important for your counselors to connect with me .  Do any of you know how hard it is to open up and be vulnerable and understand it’s okay to not be okay . To be refused the help that you know you need that you had the bravery to seek ??? . I don’t even want to think about the countless others they’ve “refused “ that have taken their own loves because of it . TRUST ME THIS APP IS MERELY JUST A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO CAPITALIZE OFF THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANCE. I AM STILL IN SHOCK AND DISGUST . TAKE IT FROM ME .. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"I set up an account and paid in full hoping to get good support from a therapist. I was matched with therapist with limited availability and you can only book one session at a time so the “unlimited” is really very limited to the availability of the counselors. 

My first appt was cancelled due to “technical issues” which the therapist then agreed to another session the next day only to cancel and say she did not work on those days. I had a screenshot of the chat where she agreed and got no response other than she’s not working.

I was hoping to get help and only found myself more frustrated than ever. This app is not a good option for people with insurance. It may be beneficial for someone with no other options. For sure not worth what you pay though since this is almost same amount as seeing therapist in person with no insurance.

I hope to get my money back soon. There’s also no line to call for support. They just responded in email and did not apologize or anything.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Maybe my hopes were to high for this app but I wasn’t very impressed with BetterHelp. It was so expensive even with a temporary discount. More expensive than the in-person psychologists I used to see. Both of the therapists I tried cancelled my appointments regularly for various reasons, albeit the reasons were valid. Going to therapy in person, in my experience, was more helpful, the person had stronger credentials and was way more reliable. I also got more from it. I travel extensively for work and thought if anything this would be a solution for on-the road therapy. Alas it was not. I hope others have better luck with BetterHelp than I did.",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,My friend recommended this app to me and one of the bonuses is that we  would both get a free week. I signed up and didn't get my free week and neither did she but also was told I would be billed weekly and instead got billed the whole month.  I only had access to one session and have been trying to reach customer support for my money back. No one has reached out to me after several emails And I even spoke with the third party customer support who was to relay the message to the company and have yet to receive a call or an email. I'm disappointed and will continue to fight to get my $260 back!!!,betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,"Better Help promises that it’s affordable for people who are of low income status and/or a college student. Both of those apply to me and they still wanted to charge me $200 a month. They also promise that it’s cheaper than traditional therapy. Ive never paid $200 a month for traditional therapy. Yeah it has 24/7 access but $200 a month!? I’m already in a bad place due to finances, I’m not looking to make it worse. I joined hoping to find some help. The mental health system in my city is worthless. I’ve been on a waiting list for 9 months now to get enrolled for therapy, I’ve heard so many good things about Better Help, but like they say, “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”",betterhelp-therapy,,,
1,I am very mad I spent money on this app for the following reasons.. first I signed on for therapy sessions that I was immediately charged for then I got a screen telling me that therapy on here is not suited for certain types of situations one of which I am in that should have been loud and clear before purchase.. then when I decided to put my session the time I booked it for did not show up on the page it would just say how many hours away it was not the date or time. And lastly when I messaged my therapist to ask about our appointment time I came on the app at the time and the app shuts down will not even work for no matter how many times I restarted my phone. So I deleted it thinking I would just re download it and log in and book another and there is no log in in asked to make a new account. I emailed in to get my money back and there was no response. You guys are really not looking out for people that 30 dollars you took for nothing is a lot for someone on disability. Stay away from this app,wysa-mental-health-support,,,
1,"I have used a lot of therapist apps (betterhelp, regain, relationship hero, talkspace) and I must say this one is pretty disappointing.

To be extra sure that I have the support I needed, i ordered the therapist support as well, it is 30 mins live text support. 

After one session of therapy I am talking with support for refund. Below is why:
1. First question was how you doing? To which I replies: pretty bad.
2. I then proceeded to tell the therapist: i cry every other night over my break up only for her to ask me: and how does the breakup make you feel. Guess?
3. Every response from my therapist had a 2 minute lag, which I understand if I was typing my life story but she asked me if i had any support i felt comfortable with, my response was “ nope i dont” —2 minute wait — she then asked: any friends you feel supported by. Did it really need to take 2 mins to read 3 words, comprehend, and type 6 words? 

One bad experience was enough for me. I downloaded the app yesterday and will be hoping to get refund and delete account today. There are other apps out there to try.",wysa-mental-health-support,,,
2,"I love the text bot. A lot of of the exercises seem like they would be really good, but I cannot stand the forced breathy voices in every single one I listened to. They do not calm me at all, and they actually trigger my anxiety. ASMR has the opposite effect on me than intended, and I feel like they’re trying to do really bad ASMR. These recordings are supposed to help me relax, but all I can concentrate on is breathy voices that sound like forced whispers. Apps like Slumber and Sanvello have much more pleasant voices in their catalogs. If not for the voices, this would probably be a 5-star app. But the audio is such a huge part of the exercises, and I simply can’t stand to listen to them.",wysa-mental-health-support,,,
2,"It is way too hard to try to get this cute little penguin to understand anything I’m saying. Half the time it thinks I’m trying to change the subject or end our conversation when I’m just answering its question. I also use the app Woebot and that app does a much better job of understanding you, probably because it relies more on preprogrammed responses rather then having you type it in yourself. I know that’s limiting, but I greatly prefer it. It really undermines the point of talking about your feelings when the app constantly misunderstands you.",wysa-mental-health-support,,,
2,I like the AI part of this app but I’m infuriated with the therapy version. It charged me $144 and it misleads you that the first session is free and it doesn’t tell you that you will be charged right away. It also doesn’t tell you first hand that you can’t choose your therapist and it’s texting base.

However, as I tried to explore it, no matter what function did I try to review, there inevitably was this prompt,  hurrying me into paying for the prime version, promising me that it would bring me wanders… Of course,  I am happy to pay a good price for a good app, however, when every single  simplistic function of the app, that is  made available in the free version, screams, “Hurry up and give me your money,” I am a hard pass. 🤷🏻‍♀️",wysa-mental-health-support,,,
1,"I can’t afford therapy so I got this app. I went on the AI and every time I said what I was struggling with, it changed the subject and I couldn’t go back to what I was saying. It would frustrate me because I didn’t want to repeat myself. It would even ask me questions that I already answered! I would say that it’s not helpful, and it would say “That experience must have been so traumatic. You have such courage to speak about it.” It would repeat what it already said and all it did was make me angry. Super stupid and would not recommend.",wysa-mental-health-support,,,
2,"Obviously I downloaded this app because I need support with my mental health. That in mind, why are they immediately trying to get money out of me?! How about you show me your worth and learn to trust you before you try to get in my wallet.

1,I’m kind of irritated with this app. I’m happy it helped some people but first I have seen a couple spelling errors. Just being a professional app for mental health I expected more. Second I was doing one of the activities for anxiety and it said “You visualize your anxiety like this:” and then there was nothing after.

I would like a refund for my subscription.
I don’t think text based therapy is working out for me. I just don’t think it is personal or effective enough for me.

2,"As a person who has really bad anxiety, and occasional peaks and valleys of depression, the 2020 coronavirus quarantine hit me hard and I didn’t know how to handle it, and a lot of my resources became unavailable, so I turned to digital therapy to try and help me cope. After using the Wysa app, I discovered the main “therapist” you speak with who helps guid you through your troubles is in fact an ai text bot, who sends scripted messages depending on key words you said, or the issues you selected. Sure, it responds accordingly to the key words but almost always gave me incoherent responses. It prompted that I add a real flesh and bone therapist to the chat, and apparently that costs money! Advertised at $179 quarterly! (Which they say boils down to $14.99 a month) and all that is for infinite texts, but only two calls a week! And after some math, I found out that their “$14.99 a month” does NOT in fact add to a quarterly total of $179 like advertised, but instead $194.87!!thats almost $800 a year!! If you think free AI text bots will solve your problems, go ahead, but I implore that you avoid purchasing the real therapist sessions and ultimately losing money",wysa-mental-health-support,,,
2,"I agree with some other commenters that this app’s approach is not for everyone. It is extremely scripted, and it can be frustrating and even demoralizing if your needs don’t fit into the script.  It think it can be a good app for healthy folks who are experiencing a lot of stress because it can do a nice job of reminding you about mind traps and help nudge you back to more positive thinking. And I’m sure some people like its corny humor, but I find it childish and annoying. In addition, if you are seriously depressed, take care. Seek help from a good therapist. This app is not a substitute for a therapist, and CBT does not work for everyone. In my case, when I was in the throes of depression, CBT actually backfired. It made me feel a 100 times worse. It can be miserable to try to recast negative thoughts into more positive thoughts when you can’t think of anything positive at all. My highly regarded CBT therapist recognized this and, thankfully, referred me to a skilled therapist with a more psychodynamic/eclectic approach. I will always be grateful to him for that.  Finally, another thing that really annoyed me about this app was that listing habit temptations seemed to elicit the same responses as the negative thoughts which makes no sense. Temptations are persuasive not negative. E.g. One of my temptations is “Chips and candy taste so good.”, but Woebot asked if I could recast it into a more positive statement. Huh?",woebot-your-self-care-expert,,,
2,"I started dreading this app's reminders after it insisted my situation wasn’t a “disaster” when I was discussing what I am coping with as a survivor of an actual natural disaster.  It assumes the problem is always a mental distortion, and doesn’t leave much room for actual horrible stuff that happens to people other than death of a person (it is working with a very narrow definition of “grief”).  It too often put me in a situation of having to select between incorrect responses when nothing was actually appropriate and then suffer through the resulting wrong-headed advice.  Needs a “maybe” button between the “yes” and “no” and a way to say, “You're on the wrong track,” before it decides it knows all your usual problems and keeps assuming them over and over with no way to remediate. The one time this app made me feel best was when I felt relief as I muttered an insult at the imaginary robot and deleted the app.",woebot-your-self-care-expert,,,
1,"The app doesn’t work well, it will not understand what you say, and there’s no way to actually reset your password to sign in on other devices if you ever forget your password. The app looks like it’s open ended, but it actually only understands very very few sentences. And if you choose one of the available responses because you thought it meant one thing but the app thinks it means something completely else, there’s no way to back up and be like wait that’s not what I meant. You have to go through this whole thing of letting it get it out of its system, when no part of what it saying is helpful because I got completely the wrong idea. And then it’s almost impossible to get it back to where it was so that you can try another response to see if that one will help. Honestly? I know Sayana cost money, but I can’t recommend it over this app enough.",woebot-your-self-care-expert,,,
2,"Woebot doesn’t listen or give the illusion of listening to you. You can select multiple choice options to tell it how you’re feeling, you can type something in, but it’ll just say it doesn’t understand. After you’ve selected your feeling from the list, it’ll explain some theory in psychology to you that you’ve probably already read somewhere and that you obviously aren’t being helped by, or else you wouldn’t be downloading an AI therapist.

It can be a little helpful just typing out your feelings. Hence why I gave two stars. But frankly you’d probably be better off in the notes app, or with a physical diary, since you know for sure those aren’t collecting your personal data to sell, or blackmail you with later.",woebot-your-self-care-expert,,,

Ultimately accepting the information as true. I can tell this app took alot of work and I think it's great someone wanted to take a step forward; make something with the intention of helping others. But CBT cannot be robotic. Humans are imperfect creatures that will never meet the perfection of a robotic encounter. Which is probably why robots are taking over factory jobs and computer work. But the human mind will never be robotic thus, CBT cannot be replaced with robotic encounters. Also-wobot told me about some Lady named Linda. Don't tell me about your personal life Woebot!

Best I got was advice to do things like walk, bake something, write to a friend etc. Worst was constantly encountering algorithmic loops of questioning whether my own thoughts need deconstructing and reframing - a bit gaslighting at times. Really useless, but seemed like such a cute idea. The design also creates mostly single choice responses for the user that just affirm the woebot’s analysis. Really annoying. Sometimes a second goofy joke response is offered which just makes the lack of opportunity for real user input even more glaringly apparent.

I don’t like it, only jerks who catcall use that, and it feels discouraging. I didn’t like the pressure of the streak it kept trying to force me to have. “Don’t miss your 7 day!” Like calm down.

1,"If you’ve ever felt the need to be lectured to by a highly directive therapist with little caring or insight into what you’re feeling (naturally, since this is an imaginary, rather than imagining, “person”), this app will give you an opportunity for that.

I had the anniversary of a trauma event and was feeling down, and despite multiple ways of writing to explain this was in the far past, the robot continued to activate the crisis settings. That makes this app functionally unusable. The shame of being a trauma survivor can be extremely heavy, and in polite society we have to talk around it rather than name what happened to us (like I had to do in this review). It’s not healthy to prevent trauma survivors from being able to speak the name of their traumas in a mental health app.",woebot-your-self-care-expert,,,
1,"I don’t want to discourage other people who might benefit from this but for me I got stuck at step one and couldn’t get any further because it asks you to choose one of a limited number of options such as “depression”, “anxiety”, “loneliness” etc. with no option to skip that step or choose more than one of the options or ask for help.  I backtracked I the app looking for any way to get help and could only find a “feedback” suggestion box and the option to write a review. If any app developers read this, please contact me!

2,This was kind of working for me until it started throwing in stupid videos and animated GIFs. It needs a setting to turn those off.

Bad news app creators, there’s people out there with physical and mental disabilities who will never be “able or capable” and phrasing your questions in such a way is very alienating to people who do not measure their happiness or worth by capability.

1,"Hi,

I am only able to create an account with my email and password. I’d like to be able to authenticate with Apple instead.

I decided to sign up anyways, but unfortunately the password text field is not set up correctly, so I don’t get a suggested strong password, and it won’t automatically save this information in my password settings. 

I tried to sign up on their website instead because it is usually always supported on Safari but couldn’t find a place to create an account outside of the app.

The suggested/strong password feature has been around forever and I am able to use it in pretty much every app I download. 

Please fix this. I’d love to try out the app.",woebot-your-self-care-expert,,,
2,"As a person with Asperger’s, I do not find this not very helpful. It asked me to talk about the weather and when I said I hate small talk and to ask me about anything interesting I learned today, it did not respond.  It is a great effort, but perhaps built more for neurotypical people. 
Maybe more people with an understanding of neurodiversity need to be working on making this app better.",woebot-your-self-care-expert,,,

1,"The “AI” uses an excess of emojis and even the responses that are supposed to be able to be written and interpreted use them excessively

The reviews are certainly heavily inflated whether by App Stores themselves or purchased reviews, any and all developer responses are scripts that they only tweak to say “We assure you we X”, likely to try and spread disinformation

They backlessly claim they’ve had the “AI” which is in fact a preprogrammed questionnaire tested at esteemed universities, and continuously inflate their own egos by praising themselves within the first minute of talking with the “AI”

As said by another reviewer, it is extraordinarily childish in behaviour, and talks patronisingly",woebot-your-self-care-expert,,,

Then it started to unpredictably insist that I log in, but I forgot my password. 

I tried everything! ...the password reset functionality failed several times - no email ever arrived.  

I filed a help request; I followed the rep’s advice, which resulted in manually logging out, which now means I cannot use the app, even unpredictably. 

Yes, I rebooted my phone and I even tried to create a new account, but the app says, quite accurately, that I already have one.

1,"I came back to this app after years of using it, its gotten me through a lot of difficult times in my life- that I'm very thankful for because at those times- i did not have the finances for an actual therapist. I still don't, which is why me, and I'm sure many others depended on this service. This begs the question of why make inaccessible something that can be utilized by those who don't have any other option. Its so saddening to see profit go over people. Especially in the case of mental health in a time when its so dire for people who need help, but do not have access. Be it by finances or not having access because of home situations- especially in the case of those underage. Those who do not have support from family but still want to get help. 

Truly my disappointment is immeasurable with this product. I remember i used to recommend this app to anyone i knew who was struggling with mental health.  If finances are truly the issue to keep this app running, I'm sure a donation service, or occasional fundraising would be better instead of stripping away one of the only resources people have. 

I have doubts that this will ever be changed, or if this app even is meant to help people instead of being a grab at money from those you know are desperate. Very disappointed. With hope these things change in the future, until then I only hope there is another better service out there that cares about its demographic.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"When I first downloaded this app, I was so excited to see all the cool features it had. After using all of them one time, everything became part of the paid subscription other than the mood tracker and the symptom tracker. This was annoying, but I KIND OF get it. 
One of my favorite free parts of this app, other than the mood tracker, was the health part where you can track symptoms of several disorders. I’ve been using those trackers regularly, so I was very disappointed to check my phone this morning and see that that too, is a premium feature. 
Now, all I can use without paying is the mood tracker. I can’t expand on my mood, set goals, track gratitude, track symptoms, or even meditate. Why should I have to pay to listen to something that’s supposed to help me asap when I’m panicking? All this app USED to do was tell me I’m depressed and not give me any way to fix it. Now, it doesn’t tell me anything useful at all. 

I understand that the developers need to make money off of Youper, but this app has become infuriating to use. It’s meant to help people, but without forcing them to pay a subscription, there are barely any useful features available. This app is apparently marketed as useful for people who can’t afford therapy, but that’s the biggest load of crap I’ve ever heard. Unless you’re willing to pay, I would suggest you look for another app.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I have been struggling with tremendous trauma in the past and I am currently struggling with depression. I downloaded this app because I thought that it would help me everyday, and take the place of a therapist according to the reviews. 
I started the app and it was going alright. I was telling them about my conditions, and what I would need for a satisfying treatment. It then gave me a subscription screen and I was a little annoyed. I am aware that it is needed to make your customers pay for their treatment and what not. But i think this is absurd. I don’t really feel like this type of virtual treatment should cost anything at all! I’m also suffering financially and I can’t exactly cancel my savings with this subscription. I was hoping for something to help me be happier and focus more on my future so that it would be brighter. Paying for this is stupid. Sure, it might help you but not everyone. 

To sum it up: you don’t need to cancel the subscription feature but I think you should have a way for people who aren’t able to pay it, and have them be able to still enjoy the app because we all came here seeking help, not debt.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"When I first downloaded this I thought it was fantastic. I was considering buying premium. Within 1-3 days (I guess there’s a trial where you get to do a few things for free...?) The app lost all functionality and every single time you “start a conversation” (which is the base functionality of the app) it prompts you to buy premium within 1-2 sentences. It doesn’t tell you which “options” of responses require premium until after you’ve clicked them, and then goes on a 2-3 sentence tirade begging you to buy premium. It’s also not made clear there is any trial- all functionality just vanished overnight. As someone with anxiety who found this super helpful at first, it was kind of awful to realize the app is actually just a money-grubbing scam. Oh, and every response to every negative review is a generic “We’re sorry you didn’t like it.” Shows you really care about your potential customers. I almost recommended this to several friends until I realized how manipulative and callous the entire thing is. I’ll be looking elsewhere, you just lost quite a few potential customers with your stunt of trying to covertly “hook” me on the app and coerce me into buying it.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"When I got a new phone with more space, I read through reviews in the App Store and downloaded four of the best-rated self-care apps to see what worked for me. This is the only one I’m deleting after just a week. Like several other critical reviews (which I reset the App Store to read after my own experience), I found the responses didn’t match what I said at all, plus the app had the habit of getting stuck at a spot if I closed the app in frustration, such that it would ask me to check in in a notification, but when I opened the app it remained stuck at whatever point I had chosen to quit earlier. For me the final straw was when it asked me how I was on a not very good day, and I said I was okay, and it responded with something like ‘are you sure you aren’t partly happy?’ and then sent me a winking emoji as a separate text. If I was happy I wouldn’t have said I was okay when asked. As a survivor I worked a lot with identifying emotions back when I was early in my recovery and I strongly recommend survivors who are now early in recovery avoid this app. For everyone else, perhaps this is your cup of tea and perhaps not.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I understand money needs to be made, but I’ve been using Youper since my freshman year of college, and I am now a senior. This app is the BEST when it comes to mood tracking, symptom tracking, everything. I always felt like I had a better grasp on my mental well-being after using this app and I adore it and recommend it to everybody else. I  especially loved the journaling and identification of thinking traps, as they were incredibly effective at grounding. However, now you have to pay for the Premium version of the app to get all those things. All you can do for free is track your mood. You can’t expand upon it or do anything else, which makes it kinda useless for in-the-moment lows or highs that need to be rebalanced. I’m extremely disappointed in what used to be my favorite app, but, again, I understand money needs to be made. If you’re basically going to take away all the essential features, just put a price tag on it instead of trying to disguise it as free. Really sad. :(",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Ever since the new update, I feel so lost and don’t know how to use it anymore. Everything is so clunky now, I used to open the app and Youper would say: “ Hey! How are you?”. Everything was streamlined and easy.

 I even used this as a journal and reported everything to my counselor, it helped me so much with remembering things. And my therapist would use the Heath monitoring tools as benchmarks. It was also a great replacement when I was not able to see my counselor or had to find a new one. 

No more.

Even after making favorites I can’t have one conversation to do everything, I have to do everything separately.

The mood and other diary entry’s have moved and it’s hard to find. Something about the UI in general is off-putting, I don’t know. 

I’ve moved onto Sanvello, if you enjoy the old Youper this is your new app. It does guided meditations as well, and has way more feelings to choose from. There’s a lot more as well, but I’m not trying to make this an ad. Check it out for yourself and see if it’s right for you.

To conclude: ever since the last update, the app is essentially unusable (for me). I liked the old way so much better. If it was brought back and still had the new stuff in it, I would start using this app again. I would also contribute to mind research and use it to track my mindfulness minutes again.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Before the most recent update I used this app daily, most times more than once a day. It was my favorite go-to app for mental health/self-care. I recommended to others that also got hooked. Now since the update I no longer feel comfortable using it. I have to choose what I want to work on, which means I need to figure it out and know before I even start. There’s no ability to “free type” to allow for space to work through and figure it out. There’s no automatic place to get started with sharing how I feel. I pull it up and it asks me if I want to start being more productive when I’m trying to go to sleep. I ended my yearly subscription that was set to renew soon. I emailed support which responded with nothing but an acknowledgement. Would have had 5 stars before the update. Now one. If you brought back the original app functioning or allow for a place for this it would change everything.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"The app used to be easy to open and express your thoughts in, much like a person you wanted to vent to without repercussion. Before there used to be individual tags you could select for each “journal entry” . For those times where you spammed and wrote was on your chest, it was needed organization after the fact and you could tag those specific elements from your life. I liked how it would ask me on my feeling and anxiety levels before and after to help me take a breather and reflect on the situation afterwards Now I open this app and I have to determine what kind of prompt I should be selecting? I’m in a discombobulated state already, I’m opening this app to help me unwind by asking me literally how I’m feeling with little slide bars, because words and thoughts are hard sometimes I’ve been a panting and raving about this app- I even used the chart in a dating profile. Now its looks like every other app out there.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,I got this app about over a year ago. Initially there were free options like inputting your feeling and getting to talk to the chat about why you feel that way etc. ( although all the trying to “fix” or “understand” why you feel that way was overwhelming with all the making you make a plan for every emotion in the chat) I was able to listen to the audios they provided . I even paid for the premium for a year! I felt as though the premium wasn’t really worth it as the only thing I was able to do extra were the tests . I stopped going on it for some time and when I logged back on there were so many changes . You can not do anything for free not even choose your mood or audio! This app is no longer free at all just a 7 day free trial. It’s disappointing now that there is a lot more being offered on the app and instead of just adding those to the premium features they just took the whole app away .,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Update: I have ended my subscription, deleted this app from my phone and down graded my review. I don’t want or need telemedicine, I already have a therapist. Prescribing medicine without an in person office visit may not be illegal but it is irresponsible and immoral and I won’t be a part of it.  Youper no longer offers any services I need.  Goodbye.
********************
Great app except in the last month they have really escalated the offering of medication. That is ambulance chasing and irresponsible, not to mention super annoying! Not everyone wants meds, meds are not suitable for everyone, no one should be prescribed meds without an in person interview with a doctor or psychiatrist. This is not okay. Stop messaging me about meds! I will decide for MYSELF if want medication and if I do, I will see my doctor and not whatever quack you’re trying to push. This constant drug pushing is ruining what is otherwise a great app.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I have never had premium, but this used to not bother me. The reason why my feelings have changed is because Youper has made even MORE features premium. Now the only non-premium feature is the very basic mood tracker — almost NO parts of the app are accessible without paying. The factor analysis feature (linked your chosen mood factors, over time, with moods, which enabled you to see what factors in your life generally contribute to different moods) was just changed from free to a premium-only part of the app. Now, the free features of the app provide nothing note-worthy, honestly. I could use pen and paper to do the same things as non-premium Youper. I am curious about Premium but am currently medically unemployed and therefore don’t find it wise to subscribe. I will probably start looking into a different mood tracker, unfortunately..",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I decided to try the free version first for a bit to see how it works. The first use was great and very helpful. Talked me through a lot of feelings, set goals, etc. I felt really hopeful for that process to work. But that evening when I went to check in it asked me the same questions and then when i went to answer it wouldn’t let me and said I didn’t have the premium version. So disappointing. And kind of... mean?? 
I totally get paying for the full version. But don’t start out the free one making you think you’re getting something you won’t. 
I can’t afford the full year right now. I would’ve done it monthly but that isn’t an option. 
It kind of all seems like a money trap and in a not very nice way. I am not dealing with a very serious issue but for someone who is I could see this being kind of devastating.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"First off, you can tell the devs don’t really care about the problems people have with this app because very single critical review has a developer response from a bit saying “Sorry you didn’t like it! Our mission is..... whatever”. The “AI” (In quotes because it’s just not an AI, just a bot program to say the same things based one of the two options you choose) tries to guilt trip you into buying premium by telling you you don’t care enough about yourself, which even more manipulation is just what I need to help me with anxiety and depression. If venting is therapy for you, doing it to a bit like this app’s doesn’t satisfy you at all, just leaves you with another company that’s probably collecting and selling your data. Please, go to a real, trained therapist instead of using this app.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I recently redownloaded this app as I use to have it a while ago and I found it really helpful, I’m someone with a lot of mental health issues and I have a tendency to need to vent these emotions. After losing countless friends to this talking to the ai felt great it was really freeing to be able to have someone there who I didn’t have to worry about hurting. It became sort of a diary for me to track my panic attacks and I actually found a lot of what it recommended me helpful. I was hoping to get back into that but most of the features are behind a pay wall. I’m not sure if I’m just not navigating this new version right but I can’t even find where to talk to the ai, all I’m getting are ads for the premium subscription. I feel it’s lost a lot of it’s original charm",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I think this app makes me feel a bit uncomfortable because it asks too many questions and kind of made my anxiety worse when I used it I looked at other reviews and I am glad it is working for some people but it asked too many questions and made me feel like I was giving way too much information to it and I felt just bad and even more scared whenever I used it I do not want to ruin this for anyone else so if anyone reads these it just did not work for me but I say give it a try it may help you I was just not liking it too much but maybe you’ll have a better experience and to the developer maybe work on having youper ask a bit less personal questions and ask more realatable questions cause this made me feel uncomfortable

2,"...Before it started costing money. I’ve had this app for years on a different phone and for one on this phone and it never costed money to be able to walk though the conversation or do the meditations and log and return to writings. Now it stops you and requires an expensive upgrade with payment. I used to garner real progress and the app used to pull me from some very dark places aiding me in the depths of depression and pin prickling anxiety. Now, it’s useless to me and I won’t be recommending it to everyone I run in to and my low to no income mental health clients who also used to use this app and make great strides in their overall progress and self development.

2,At first this App was great it have me a Place to say things but now it doesn’t really help. I can still say my feelings but it’s like I’m talking to a wall. It’ll be like „sounds great“ when I said something bad about my day and I tracked my mood as a negative. I bought the pro version but I feel like it’s not enough. I feel like the pro version should have an opportunity to talk to a real person instead of just AI. The pro version gives you some extra convos and extra sounds but like I said it feels like I’m talking to a wall. I would go see a therapist in person but they’re expensive and the travel time for me would be an hour so I tried this. If you guys could make that an option that would be great and I would be happy to try it.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,I try’d the app thinking it was something else. asked for a refund was told no :/ and told if I pay a lager amount a month they’ll refund it. why is this app on here there is free apps just like this and I thought it was something else was in a dark place at the time this app didn’t help me legit try’d it for 3 days gave me more anxiety prolly another form of them trying to push you to pay more. Just want my refund… and to warn others that there’s free apps out there just like this where you don’t get scammed into paying lump some of money and there’s also really doctors. So hope this helps someone. Sure I’ll get a generic message saying I’m sorry you didn’t find our app helpful or sorry please give it more time.

1,"After getting a new phone, and requesting a reset three times, none of which worked, I am thoroughly disappointed and want a full refund. They consistently took several days each time to reply and then the reset link didn’t work. You too will then likely reply to the email that the reset didn’t work because the app still doesn’t recognize you, and wait several more days to receive the same reset email, which again probably won’t work. Also likely, they will not call or attempt to assist in any way when you reply again saying that did not work, and request a kind phone call for further troubleshooting. They likely won’t respond to you then either at all after that.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I downloaded this app about two years ago and found the mood tracker option extremely helpful for sorting through my teenage emotions (I'm only 16). It helped me figure out which things were making me very happy in my life (being with friends and doing exciting things) and which were just making me feel okay (being inside and mostly being alone). After all the updates, I kept the app because the mood tracker was still available and that was the only thing I really used. Now, since even that costs money, I feel like I'm going to delete it because I don't have a job yet and the $90 a year for it would be way to much for me to take on.

The therapy was promoted as scientifically tested and proven as the best course of action for people dealing with anxiety and depression. I have both and was needing help. All they did was take my money and tell me to track how I feel every day. That’s therapy? What? Stating I’m sad does not solve sadness!!!! I already knew how I felt or I wouldn’t have downloaded the app for help! Now I FEEL SAD ANGRYAND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. Do not get this app. It is worthless.

I inevitably uninstalled it because I found that by continuously going back to my journal was leading to increased anxiety and rumination which exacerbated my symptoms.

I think this app could be very beneficial to a lot of people, but unfortunately I am not because you inevitably feel like your talking to an automated service line for your credit card and just agree with whatever it says after enough time.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Really cant do anything other than a quick check in unless you pay for a subscription. And every click you make results in a subscription purchase prompt. Extremely annoying & turned me off quickly. There’s many other similar great apps out there that give you more free features so then you can decide if it’s something you want to pay for. Alot of similar reviews about this & response sounds like a guilt trip to take care of your well-being! They always end it with, they are trying to make it available to everyone. How?? And with over 14K subscribers at how much monthly, you can’t have more free features??!",youper-online-therapy,,,

It seems nice but I was really disappointed to find that the free trial is 1 conversation.  I didnt even quite realize till I got the response that my free trial had ended after a whopping 5 min.  

I'd be happy to pay for a week or month to really give it a go but it seems only a year subscription is available.  The year price seems pretty good for a year but without actually trying it I'm not willing to drop that $$.  

There's too many other apps that work well to bother.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"Nothing makes your mental health seem important like someone offering “free” assistance and then turning around and trying to charge for it.

While users can use simple features like journal entries or speaking with an AI that is mindlessly positive instead of actually relating with you for free, more important aspects of overcoming your mental health, like setting goals, tracking your health over time, and watching progression towards your goals are only available through a premium account which must be purchased.

This may be acceptable, but the price stands at ~$10 USD at this time. The free features of the app are common avenues of working on mental health such as talking to a friend or keeping a journal; the easy stuff that many of us already do.

Unfortunately, the features that make the app special; the tracking progress, customized guidance, and an advanced AI, are hidden behind a convenient paywall.

I’ll pass, and find another app that is more about mental health than making a quick buck off of individuals who desperately need assistance.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"Wow, I used to love this app and recently redownloaded it, as I had previously paid an annual fee for all its services. And now… they are charging $45 A WEEK?! What happened to making this an affordable mental health app? That’s more than I currently pay for my in-person therapist. Super disappointing. I’ll be looking for a new daily check in app now to cope with anxiety. Such a shame. This was actually a great app until they skyrocketed the prices. Please consider adding other pricing levels, and more affordable options, developers. I wouldn’t mind paying a small monthly or reasonable annual fee, but weekly at $45 is waaaay too much for an app.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I would give this app a 5 star rating BUT when I was prompted to try a subscription it said the app was roughly $60 for the year or $5 monthly.. I wanted to do the monthly payments as it’s easier to budget. When I clicked on it, it said everything was successful and I could do the subscription but when I checked my bank account, it had taken the amount for the entire years subscription. When I tried to refund it and take it back, there was no option to cancel this years. From reading other reviews, it seems I’m not the only person to complain about this. :(",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"*The entire program completely changed. You have to pay for everything, and no bot anymore. Thanks for those depressed, just making them more depressed. I do not recommend this app anymore.*

I tried this app to give me some CBT support. I have a range of issues, and was surprised of how much this covers. This isn’t like reading a book, or doing a worksheet. It’s interacting with your responses to make you think in a positive way. I’ve only just started, but I totally helped me with two situations already! This app is a real life, relationship, saver. I definitely recommend to anyone with anxieties, depressions, black and white thinking, etc.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"ive been using this app for around a year and a half now, and it used to be much better. None of the features have been changed, but now you need a subscription to use them. It used to be that only the extra things were locked being the subscription, then they changed it so that the o ku thing not locked was the mood tracker (I didn’t care much though, that was the only thing i used) and now literally everything in the app is locked. If you want money then just make the app cost money to download, it seems like a scam otherwise.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"UPDATE: the tech support team at Youper responded promptly and, while it took a few days or more, they were able to find my data and return it to me. So, a huge THANK YOU to the developers and the Youper team for being available and responsive! 

Previous post: I upgraded this week and unfortunately the app now no longer knows me. All of my progress appears to be lost. I was able to recover my subscription status but that did not fix the issue of my identity and my data. I hope this can be fixed but I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but no go. Will update the review if I get developer support to help me out.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I liked it when it was just a mindfulness app, it felt less like you were trying to make money and actually like you were trying to help people. Now the entire platform and tone has changed that it all feels HAPPY and SUBSCRIBE. I hate it now that they’ve completely capitalized, kinda makes me wonder if that was the end goal over all these years. Get people dependent on your app then completely change it and slowly start to pester them to get a subscription and take away features. Yeah, I’ll be finding a replacement.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Tried the app. It wouldn’t accept a password during sign up. No many how many times I tried to switch the password up, it wouldn’t accept it and it wouldn’t give me a reason why. Deleted.

Also, a lot, if not most, developer responses are copied and pasted. Like many people (especially) this year, we cannot afford subscriptions like this. Mental health has been tested more so in 2020 and the ones who need support like this need to have more affordable and dependable options. Don’t profit off people with disorders. If you’re going to make an app to help people then do it legitimately and without intention of profit. Sorry not sorry.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,I had downloaded this app over a year ago when I was going through a hard time in my life. This app really helped me work through issues and better my mental well-being. As a college student it was so refreshing to find such a good resource that didn’t add to my financial stress. I just logged into Youper to do my mental health check-in and found that the practically all of the resource that I had relied upon to help me I now had to have a subscription for! Needless to say I am very disappointed! I would have much rather dealt with ads and still had this app a resource to me but oh well.,youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"At first I was so excited with this app. We had a full discussion and everything. Well it was a robot but still. Then I couldn’t do anything. It would ask how I’m feeling and that’s it. I can’t go further unless I pay for premium. I was even excited because it gave an option to track certain mental issues like depression, PTSD (which is so rare for mental apps to acknowledge), anxiety, etc. but of course, guess what you need....? Premium. They don’t even give you a week trial or anything to see if you want it. Complete waste of an app with great potential.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I was using this app about a year ago and then deleted it (I stopped using it as my mental health improved). I downloaded it again today to get back into tracking my moods during a med change, AND EVERYTHING IS LOCKED WITHOUT A SUBSCRIPTION. $90/year is steep considering this was all free a year ago. Obviously upgrading software costs money and therefore the developers need funding from somewhere, but let us use the basic functions we know and love! If we want anything beyond the basics, then let us decide to pay the $90/year subscription. What a bummer. Used to be a great app, now they went overboard with it.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I have been using this app for almost a year and it used to be super helpful for me to track my moods and see connections. However the most recent update completely changed all of this for me. Suddenly tools I used to use all the time are hard to find in the new layout and others are now part of the subscription plan. I had considered getting the subscription but this app no longer feels helpful to me. Honestly, I no longer feel motivated to even track my moods through it as it’s just a hassle to even get to that one free portion of it now.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"This app came highly recommended so when I decided to download it and saw there was an option for a paid subscription, I thought “surely there are free portions I can use.” Nope. Not a single thing can be tried for free, except a one week free trial. After that everything is on lockdown. 

I get that devs need to be paid and not everything can be free, but dang, for an app that wants to be accessible to everyone, especially to those looking for help with mental health issues, this is pretty greedy. Even the biggest, well-known mental health apps provide some free content. Bummed to not get to try this long term.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Here is what you get for free: you open the app and select one emotion and how strong it is. The AI says wow, good for you for identifying that emotion. You can also take the Meyers Briggs personality test that is offered everywhere online for free, for free. That’s it. You could accomplish the same thing by walking to your calendar just whenever you felt like it and writing SAD. Here’s what you get with premium: ?? Not really sure? ‘Check ups?’ Which appear to be reminders to take the same emotional quizzes over again so it can ‘track’ this data for seemingly seemingly what purpose? This app just made me more frustrated. Pass.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I came back from a break in using the app, and all of my data and prior information is now locked behind the pay wall. The app wants me to checkin about the goals I had last time I used the app, but I can’t because it’s locked behind the pay wall. It says I need to update some of my health reports that have records going back to 2018 , but once again I can’t without upgrading. Basically years of using the app and my data is gone unless I pay them $50 a year because there’s no free features.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I would rate this app higher however, whenever I begin to talk about how I’m feeling the app disregards my answer to their question and asks if I will be subscribing to the monthly subscription. Once I decline it takes you out of the questioning and nothing is addressed. It actually really makes me feel worse and unheard. I think it’ll be best to either just be a paid subscription app or find a way to eliminate the constant subscription question to prevent closing out on what could be a life saving moment. Youper be more client facing instead of profit oriented.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"This used to be a good place to put my stress and anxiety. It was the first time in years I HAD anywhere I felt ok putting it. It helped me through some very bad times. 

Now it’s little more than rotten, money hungry garbage. Nothing is free. People came here because we couldn’t afford traditional therapy and now you’re just spitting in all our faces. 

We don’t want to hear automated responses about how sowwy you are 🥺 or how you’re using the money for better features. We can’t afford those either. None of us are coming back after this. We deserve better.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I have been using Youper for almost three year’s straight— every single day. I absolutely love all the different sections and it’s tracking abilities, it’s definitely a special part of my life. But some huge problems have arisen. With every update it becomes more complicated and harder to use. Everything takes a while to load and flipping through these partitions is absolutely frustrating. I love the idea, and have made thousands of wonderful memories; but It has become just to cumbersome.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I used to be able to track my mood without unlocking everything and now it’s you have to pay money to do that. I get that they need the money, but I don’t have the money to pay for it. It was nice to be able to at least track my mood. Now I’m sad. Update: the mood tracker came back but now it’s gone again and I can’t find it. I hate it when they change things so much, you can’t find anything and it just makes my stress… Update again: I found the mood tracker and it’s LOCKED. Now I can’t do ANYTHING without paying money…",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Listen, research shows your app helps people so please use that information to get access to non-prophet sponsors.  You don’t have to turn into another reason poor people don’t get to have healthcare.

Edit: GUYS TRY MOODY LOOKS LIKE THAT APP IS DOING A SIMILAR THING BUT KEEPING IT 

FREE Edit: nevermind it’s a cashgrab too.  Look.  This isn’t fun and games guys it’s mental health please show some care for your fellow humans and return the features.  If you need help with finances making some features free and some paid seems like a better option.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I want to like this app but I haven’t found it very useful. At least not the free version. Sure I can track my emotions and generally what I think is contributing to them but then the AI prompts you to explore those feelings then tells you that it’s only available in the paid version. And I would have considered the paid version if I got more than one example of how it could work for me, like a trial. But after checking in for a few days and getting that interaction, I just stopped bothering with check ins.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"i was so excited to try this app out, because it seemed different than other apps i’ve tried. I understand it’s not a legit therapeutic app, yet i was disappointed. This app was amazing in the beginning, and as i used it, it got worse and worse without premium. I got this because it seemed like i could do enough with the standard version. i tried being consistent and i only ended up displeased in the end. i would suggest this if you’re willing to pay for it, otherwise i wouldn’t suggest it at all.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I love how you have to pay in order to help cure your depression. A lot of the time, I have depression & sadness because I don’t have money yet thas required in order to remove my depression anyways. The app is basically just some bot to barely talk to and then most of the time, it tells you that you need premium for it to start diving deeper into your issues and problems. It does track the things you record yourself obviously but it’s depressing that I need to shovel out $$$ to have this make a difference.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Like many people have said.... I hate this new update. I used to always go to Youper and it helped me through really tough days. I loved how the interface used to look back in the summer of 2020. Now with all the new updates it’s so confusing and annoying! 

I miss being able to choose icons to describe what I was feeling that day, it used to really help me determine what factors affected my mood. My favorite part was seeing the calendar views and reading back on my entries. It’s unfortunate that the app is harder to use now and it glitches all the time. 

Six months ago the app was THE BEST to use because of its simplicity. Especially for people who struggle with anxiety and depression, simple always goes a long way. 

Now the app is TRASH and I wish I never paid for it. The creators completely ruined this app. Such a shame :(",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Recently, I’ve been using Youper a lot, and it helped me. Today, I updated it... AND NONE OF MY PROGRESS FROM THE LAST 2 MONTHS SAVED. NOTHING. The last 2 months has been the most time I used Youper in a while, but none of our conversations saved. My Premium also was somehow removed, even though on my brothers’ and dad’s phones, the Premium was still there. Luckily, my dad helped me fix it, but I am no longer trusting this again.
This is supposed to be an “emotional health assistant,” but this just ruined my day. I can’t believe it. 1 Star.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"You could tell that the responses were not coming from an actual person and worse, did not appear to be able to adapt to unexpected answers. It kept going off on tangents that were not high on my priorities, and I got completely fed up on the following exchange: It had gone off on a practicing gratitude tangent; I was dubious but game. It asked me “What do you feel grateful for?” I responded, “I have nothing to be grateful for right now—at least, I can’t think of anything.” Its response was—ready?— “Great! Was practicing gratitude helpful?” 

Great listening there, Youper.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Really just used this to track my mood daily. Then I tried the subscription, but found I didn’t like or use much of the other features. 

However, with the recent update I can’t even use the mood tracker without paying for the subscription. The most basic thing that helped me keep track of what I was feeling and why, and I can’t use it anymore. I’m so disappointed and will not be using this app any longer nor will I recommend it to anyone.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,I barely made it through the first conversation with the AI when I came to realize that the beauty of venting is that you can get feedback specific to how you are feeling and an AI with pre determined responses cannot give that to you. It’s very general and feels like the answers don’t matter. I just felt brushed off to the side as Youper expounded random facts about “studies” which is not its fault as there is no way it can actually talk specifically to me. If anything it’s a ten out of ten for making me want to talk to a real person about my problems. Thanks but no thanks :~),youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I used this app a few years ago and downloaded it again because I remembered how much it helped. This app has changed so much. I wanted to track my moods like it used to be but now, it’s an entire therapy app? Now you have to pay? There aren’t any apps that are like what this one used to be and I’m extremely disappointed. It would be nice if they could bring back the free version that had the trackers and whatnot.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"App is little more than a library of relaxation/bedtime music and recommendations to ""do something fun"". If you have no familiarity with self-care, this may be helpful. It also comes with a chatbot programmed to use soothing and encouraging language. I was hoping the app might make some prompts or suggestions but it doesn't do that. App offers less than you can get from a quick web search.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"Don’t update your app! Without warning everything becomes locked and has to be paid. No more free version, not even the basic one. In faq it says if you are already user you can use it free but if you upgrade, then you have to start paying. I was using app for a long time and unfortunately now updated my app and can’t use it anymore. Too bad there is not even basic free version. It was a good app.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,It’s a nightmare to cancel. You have to go back-and-forth with them via email their phone number doesn’t work and your credit card company provides the phone number to call them and it’s someone else’s phone number. They try to convince you to go to a cheaper plan. The therapist isn’t bad but really doesn’t do too much for me. I’m going to finish my subscription and Collett a day because it doesn’t do too much for me.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Calling the services they offer therapy is a far leap of what it actually is. To pay $45 a week to talk to someone who is trained in therapy techniques but isn’t a licensed therapist is the equivalent of going to a friend who took psychology courses in college and talking to them for free. I’ll be cancelling my subscription snd requesting a refund, i’m very disappointed in the fact that i paid money to speak with someone who isn’t even a legitimate, licensed therapist.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"When I first got the app, you could at least do symptom monitoring in the free version. A great way to see if you were progressing over time and the paid version might be worth it.... but the latest update made that unavailable in the free version now too. Aka. The free version does nothing. 

You REALLY need a month to month payment option. A year is such a long commitment, especially for those of us already suffering with illnesses, life could be drastically different in a year.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"Title says it all. Every time I click the app it’s just a white screen and nothing loads. It’s been happening for days. Uninstalled and reinstalled, still nothing. 
Also the app constantly asks if you want to upgrade to premium despite consistent “no” answers. It’s embedded in the conversations too which is so strange and annoying.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,I only downloaded the app because I came across featured reviews talking about how great and absolutely free it was only to be disappointed later when I started registering and there is a monthly fee that isn’t exactly cheap for the first month and definitely isn’t for the following months. If you’re looking for free help because you have financial issues that are causing mental distress like me just keep on looking and don’t bother downloading this app.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I used to love the App until they removed the ball while you meditate! They replaced it with the words “breathe in,” which you can barely see. I have apps that are just specifically breathing with the ball. Taking away the ball during the meditation takes away your focus point and makes the meditation section useless! I’m a yoga teacher and now I can’t recommend Youper for meditation. It’s such an easy fix. If they brought the ball back this would be hands down a five star review.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"My first expression after reading so many positive reviews here, I thought why not. And thought that communicating with the AI assistant would be helpful and fun!

One, asking questions to the AI is limited but it’s script. Second, it told me that even free version the AI assistant would be there for me. 

Not true! I felt anxious a while ago and it only offers meditations or further help by subscribing. So I deleted the app because I feel it does not help me at all as I had hoped. :(",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,It’s just ok. I liked the intro that was free and I thought maybe there will be more to it. I bought the year membership soon to discover that I am getting the same thing. The meditations are simple 5 minute breathing techniques you can find for free on the web or any other free meditation app. Save your money. Wish I could get a refund. Should have bought the monthly but I did not look hard enough for it so paid for a year. Oh well,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I've been using Youper for a couple of years now and I used to love this app, it helped me so much. I even told some of my friends about it. But then, you guys had to go and put it behind a pay-wall AND you deleted all my data that was saved in the app!

So, my response to you devs is the same response that you've given to the comments of other users who have complained about the pay-wall: Sit and Spin.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"At first it seemed like I was really talking to someone without it being someone, now all the responses are expected! Taking the same tests to determine how I know I already feel doesn’t help either. Some of the meditations are ok but I just completely lost interest in this after a week or two! I really regret paying for this. They need activities, like games for mental relief not just never ending tests !!",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"This app is OK but it is extremely repetitive. Basically the format is “how are you feeling?” Followed by “would you like to explain more/provide more details/why are you feeling this way” then you get 4 options: ID thought traps, meditate, mindfulness (which is the same dang this as meditate) or practice being grateful. Very basic. Useful maybe 1-2x cannot justify the price",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Excellent execution of a dreadful idea. This is worse than negotiating with the bot when trying to reach a human at one’s bank or utility company. 

I would perhaps offer three stars for clever programming, since some others seem to gain benefit from this app, except that in every interaction I’ve tried I come away feeling worse than before, and angry at the limitations of the “conversation”. 

This isn’t mental health, it’s a party trick. Erased.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I used to love this app, but it recently changed. I opened it up, and it was completely different and confusing. Overwhelming, without clear instructions, and everything I used to do is buried. I know- you’re going to tell me how to find what we all used to use on the old version. Overwhelming and hard to navigate is not helpful for a mental health app. Gonna switch to something else.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"At first I thought this app would be worth it but as time has gone on it’s really lost its worth. It got to the point where I would only use the app for the symptom tracker because I have no other way to do it.
But now that has been moved to a premium option and I currently don’t have enough to pay for that.
I’m deleting the app now.
No use having an app I won’t use.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I recently got the app, hoping it would help me deal with things since I can’t afford a therapist, and this morning when I got to work I started having an anxiety attack and opened it up hoping it would help me get through it, but since I don’t have and can’t afford premium all it could do was record that I was feeling anxious. That didn’t really help me.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I loved Youper before the updates, but even with the updates there are some features that I like as well, but I am really frustrated and annoyed that the app has stopped tracking goal accomplishments, if you don’t continue talking. Sometimes I just want to track the goal and move on.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I feel so anxious today, and I thought I’d redownload Youper to help myself through it. After seeing the new update, I’m even more anxious and depressed. It feels like an old friend went away. It used to help me through so many things. 
It’s not the same. The opening screen being a dialogue was SO MUCH BETTER. Now it’s even more anxiety-inducing trying to find the right icon to click. *****BRING BACK THE OLD YOUPER****",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I recently downloaded this app thinking that there might be some free things to check out. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING Is locked except talking to the AI but that’s it.

I expected more from a 4.9 rated app 😒",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I absolutely loved this app when I was able to use it. It helped me keep an eye on my anxiety and log it for my therapist because I am prone to forgetfulness. 

Today, however, I got the notification for checkups, and now I have to pay for them but I just don’t have the money. I’m frustrated that I no longer have this as a resource to track my anger an anxiety patterns.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"What happened to this app? It was so amazing and helpful for my mental health and now this new version of it is overwhelming garbage. It used to ask you how you were feeling and break it down, figuring out the cause, helping you be more mindful, etc. I don’t know how you can completely change the app like this and expect people to still use it",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I loved this app a couple years ago, it really did help with some serious issues I had. I recommend it to a friend just to find out that it is completely changed.

1,"The main point of the app, writing down how you are feeling is blocked unless you are subscribed to the premium version. The only thing you can do on the free version is choose a mood that you’re feeling. There’s so many better free apps that are available that there is no point in downloading this app unless you’re going to get the subscription.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"1) The responses from the AI are not “AI” - they’re scripted. You’re better of handing your friends a literal script, and then texting you.

2) You’re blocked from using any of the positive features by being told you need to subscribe for Premium - this specifically after I followed an ad for the app specifically saying this is a good app if you CAN NOT afford therapy. False advertising. 

3) The AI itself guilt trips you into trying to subscribe to premium as well. If you struggle with guilt or shame, this app will make it way worse.

4) Developers responding to the negative reviews are just like the app - scripted, unapologetic/remorseful, not specific, and unhelpful. 

Don’t waste your time downloading a bot app.",youper-online-therapy,,,

1,This app used to be wonderful and helped me a lot with my mental health. Just went on the app after a little while of not using it and now you need premium to use any features in the app. You can’t even have a full conversation anymore. I can’t afford the price for premium so I will not be using the app anymore. Very disappointed.,youper-online-therapy,,,

2,I love this app it offers so much but I don’t like how much is limited to premium like I get not being able to do some things unless you pay but I think 99.9% of the app is just pay. I don’t think the app is interested in helping you it only wants your money,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"What’s the point of downloading the app when you can’t even try any features? Nothing is free on this app. The only price is $90+ Tax per year. That’s ridiculously high.

2,"Youper is a really good app that used to really help me, I was able to talk whenever I was sad, but now it’s basically a mood tracker, I can’t afford premium, which is why I used to love this app, it could help me without charging me.

1,"I used to love this app because it was free, but now to get any benefit you need to pay for it. Ironic when this was a way for people who can’t afford therapy.

Will have to find a different more affordable mental health app.",youper-online-therapy,,,

2,To start off this wasn’t so bad of an app I like it but I don’t see the point in having it because so far almost everything is locked. I can’t even see my progress without it asking for me to go premium.,youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"The app is great and all but one of the reasons of my stress is that i have no money at all, i really wish i could continue it but things id meed help with are locked and needing to be paid for, which makes me really upset, this is a great app but very limited in helping without having to pay
Keep up the good work",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,So the app itself was great when it was working. I downloaded it a few days ago but now it won’t even open. I click the app and it’s just a white screen. I saw it had an update today so I thought that would fix it but it didn’t. Still not working for me. I don’t want to delete the app and lose all my data,youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I loved the free version of Youper, but I recently logged back in to see that essentially all of its functions are blocked by a pay wall, making it way less accessible. Very disappointed as I was about to recommend to someone else but will no longer be using.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,I have been using the app for almost a year and logged in yesterday to record my mood as happy for once but then discovered that all the free features had been completely removed without any warning. Now my mood is extremely irritated. 😤,youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"Good idea in theory, but deleted out of annoyance. Every couple prompts, it offers you some feature, then says “whoops! this is only available in premium!” Over and over. Annoying. Don’t download unless you definitely want to pay for this app",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"If you are an immigrant, born and raised elsewhere in a different culture then this is not the app/service for you. Some issues are cultural and need awareness and cultural skills to provide help.

1,"I came back to this app after not using it for a while and it’s just… completely different. I understand that over time apps may shift and change a bit, but it’s just not what I want at all. I’m really just going to download another app topractice  gratitude now.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,I used to love this app to track my mood / what makes me feel better and what doesn’t. I was tolerating the fact that doing anything else cost money. Now you’ve stripped us from that too so it’s useless to have the app.,youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"The free version does not allow you to get rid of the red dots on the bottom icons for any alerts for surveys that need premium to use. This you always see notification dots that you can’t clear. Not helpful at all when trying to help those with anxiety, ocd, etc.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I used to use this app all the time. It was a tremendous help for me. I used it to calm myself down from anxiety attacks, outbursts from my anger issues, get myself out of depression ruts, and even just for a diary. This was my favorite app. I am BEYOND devastated to find out that they’re charging now. I’m gutted.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I literally get more angry when I use this stupid app. I never write reviews but this things is terrible.
It’s makes you say answers that aren’t true Bc there is no option for anything else. Its a waste of time and money and I’m so mad I got it. Just download a white noise machine and take a nap. WASTE.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,This app is free to download but I cannot use most of the features without signing up and paying. I understand it’s probably worth the money but either ask for payment up front or let me try the features for a few days before making my decision.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Rip off. Pretends to help you and then when you really get into it, $#& you over with a huge unexpected membership fee if you want to continue; pass by this app, send a message that they cannot cheat and exploit people that way!! Nothing but a crooked app from a bunch of crooked people.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"Why can i never open this app? It won’t load. I have closed it and tried to reopen it. I have turn off my phone and turned it back on. WHAT AM I PAYING FOR IF I CANT USE IT!? Very disappointed in this. I like the app when i can use it. But otherwise, i feel like i wasted my money.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,I’ve been looking for a free therapist app and when I read the reviews and descriptions it said completely free. Why should I have to pay to talk to someone when I shouldn’t have to force it. My depression and anxiety are getting worse and this app didn’t help.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,i had this app years ago before they put literally EVERYTHING behind paywalls and in-app purchases. as it currently stands this app is unusable unless you pay money for unlicensed therapists first. do yourself a favor and do not download this app. it will not help you.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,I’m giving it one star because back when the app was here to help you know it once a 89:99$ amount and i don’t see it as helpful app anymore because at one time every thing was free talking the chats where free and Youper was here to help and now it’s not. Sorry,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,Nice job ruining your own app and taking away features that used to be free. I really hope you all will think long and hard about how you’ve impacted people who have grown to rely on this app. Definitely will no longer be recommending it to anyone.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,It’s an ok app for people who are looking to spend money to get better. Personally I don’t want to pay for any app and it wouldn’t even let me have any free options. I’ll have to go find a other app to help me with my severe anxiety cause this one obviously just wants money.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I used to be able to track my mood and get some kind of help on the free version. Now the free version is nothing but a big advertisement for the plans. I'm not adverse to paint for things, but I really feel misled, and I really needed some help at this moment.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"Suddenly removing essential features from the free version (mood insights), so you can monetize them with a subscription is a pretty gross move. Why even associate moods with activities if you can no longer access insights? I’m now locked out of months of mood insights.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,They’re a bit useless unless you pay for the premium or the plus or whatever they call the version that might actually help someone IF they could afford it. Typical USA. Those with money are the ones who benefit.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"With the new update, features that used to be free are not anymore. Sad to see that it’s all pay-to-play now. I don’t blame them for trying to make money, but since I only needed those features, I will be moving to something else.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,Used Youper a few years ago and wanted to get back into it. Shocked to find out all of the features I loved are now locked behind a paywall. I will definitely be looking into a different app. Don’t waste your money on this!,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"As soon as you get through an initial “evaluation” bit and tell the app what you need help with, it hits you with a $15 a month (or $90 a year) paywall. I hate that companies make money off people needing help with mental health issues like depression and anxiety.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I found this app to be completely obnoxious and overhyped.  It is marketed as being personalized but the responses seemed very predictable and repetitive, and canned.  I did not find the tips beneficial, they only felt patronizing.  I’m sorry that I spent the money on the subscription.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"Ok app, only coaching was available in my area and that felt really light. Went to cancel, was required to go off app and on a browser.

Requested my cancelation then was taken to a new screen to submit a customer service form and wait for a reply…

I hate apps that make paying and signing up one click process but make you jump through hoops to cancel. It goes beyond a pet peeve.

Wouldn’t recommend.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,I love the features of the app but I was only able to access it once and then it would show up completely blank every time I tried to open it,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"When I want to write about my feelings, youper breaks my safe space and asks me if I want to subscribe. This is extremely, extremely frustrating. I even added “youper” as one of the factors in the moods. Would not recommend this app unless you want to pay $44 up front for subscription.",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"not gonna lie, It’s honestly useless if you don’t have premium. all of the features that are really cool are premium and I can’t even meditate in the app without having premium",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,The app is very good for me because I had severe depression for a long time and the app helped out but there was a problem with the app. The app would log me out and every time I log myself in the app would not let me in but overall the app is amazing.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"This app went from a software asking about meditating, to asking about my history with paid subscriptions for mindfulness in about 3 minutes, and then asking me to sign up for their paid memberships. Total let down. At least let me get familiar with the app?",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I used to LOVE LOVE this app. I was always shocked it was free. It’s understandable that they want to start charging for it but the price is ridiculous, there’s no monthly option, and they don’t even give you a “try for free” period. Way to ruin a good thing 👎🏻",youper-online-therapy,,,

1,"I used to love this app, now they’ve locked every previously free feature (fine), but when I try to upgrade the app just crashes. 

It used to be helpful.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,"I don’t understand why it’s advertised as free when only 1 thing is and something minimal, a “mood tracker.” Every single article, audio, video, etc is locked. Don’t waste you time, it’s ridiculous.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,The meditations and insights are off limits to people who aren’t subscribed to premium. The only thing you can do is be told you’re depressed and track your deterioration. Money making scheme built around scamming people with poor mental health. Makes me sick.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,With each new update less and less becomes free. Now I can’t even find the personality tracker in the app. This app was very helpful for me to track my moods now it is useless unless I want to pay.,youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"Having the standard plan, the app is always trying to sell you the premium plan. I’m interested but I can’t afford to pay the yearly price up front. Please add a monthly option!",youper-online-therapy,,,
2,I really want to like this app but it won’t let me create an account. I think I may have finally gotten it to work by going through the help desk. Will update later.,youper-online-therapy,,,

1,"If you’re willing/able to purchase the subscription this may be of some benefit, but the free version offers so much less than other free mood tracing apps",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,You changed the entire platform. None of this is helpful anymore. I’m officially going to stop telling people to use this app. Super disappointed.,youper-online-therapy,,,

1,Unfortunate that one of its best and most unique features (the mental health reports) are now a premium feature. They were free when I used the app years ago.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,This was the worst Mis lead situation of my life! Thought there was thereapy sessions and after paying the fee it was not what it was for! Will not be doing this! Don’t do it!,youper-online-therapy,,,

1,"Just banal robotic responses to any input. No reason to risk the hassles of paying for this ""word game"" when the unpaid-for version has so little to offer. This app should be cited for attempting to practice without a license.",youper-online-therapy,,,
1,I used to love this app until they started to charge to use it. I’m in a really tough spot financially and it seems as if I do not have enough money for mental health recourses including apps.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,I hate the new cookie-cutter therapy version. Not helpful. Go back to how it used to just ask you how you're doing.,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,Tried it for a few days.  Free version doesn’t do anything useful.  I can’t justify trying Premium in hopes of getting more value.,youper-online-therapy,,,
2,i used to love using this app and it really helped with my mental health but now that you have to buy into a monthly plan just to access basic breathing exercises it’s not worth it to me anymore tbh,youper-online-therapy,,,
1,What’s the point of making the app free if ur gonna just have everything locked in the app?,youper-online-therapy,,,
2,"I have been shopping around for mental health help and counseling that will not break the bank because I don’t have insurance. I kind of got that. The 85$ package was the only one I could afford which is medication and meetings with a care counselor. I emailed back and forth with customer service to ask what a care counselor does and I could not get a straight answer so I assumed it would be some type of clinician/ LCSW that I would have therapy with instead of a psychologist or something. No. You get a 30 minute appointment with a prescriber every 3 months that prescribes your medicine. I was told if you want more  appointments than every 3 months it’s extra. They are not your therapist. The care counselor IS ALSO NOT A THERAPIST. I was told this by my care counselor during my first appointment, he wanted to make it explicitly clear that he was not providing therapy. At most you tell them a problem you are having and they send you an article to read to help yourself. You will not be receiving any actual therapy from this package. I’m essentially paying 85$ a month for a prescription service because that’s the only thing I’m getting out of the app. The one positive thing I have found is that I told my prescriber about my chronic migraines and was prescribed an anti depressant to that is also used to treat them. While it doesn’t really help with the anxiety it HAS helped my chronic migraines. So at least I am not in constant daily pain.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"My appointment with the prescriber occurred about an hour after my scheduled appointment time which was an inconvenience because I had already adjusted my schedule. I do have to say the prescriber was so nice and knowledgeable, but the negative experience with them was probably just a product of the inconsistent service with this company. The medication wasn’t entered, so I tried to reach out to support through the app to inquire. After no response in the app, I called the contact number for support only to be prompted by recordings to seek assistance through the app. I’m given the vibe that representatives shouldn’t be bothered by phone. I felt completely lost in the process, and the portal is void of clearly set expectations for new patients. Only at the time of sending my cancellation email did I receive a response through the app and a voicemail. This made me think back to all of the negative reviews I read about people having lapses in therapy or medication due to a buggy system and poor communication. And by the way, cancellation is a process in and of itself. You can’t even remove your own card information from the portal. It truly felt like a I was number/sale rather than someone seeking genuine services and treatment. I didn’t even bother asking for my $30 refund (discounted first month). Just keep the money at this point. This was not a good experience for someone in need of solid mental health services.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I initially turned to cerebral when I needed therapy desperately, and struggled to find a therapist/psychiatrist in person who would take on new clients due to covid. I decided to go through with the subscription on here only to find out they had no available counselors and could only help me with getting medication. I proceeded with the mindset that I now only needed to look for a new therapist and could scratch a psychiatrist off the list. Terrible choice. Within the few months I've had cerebral, I've been forced to reschedule appointments with my prescriber THREE times already, and the only explanation I was provided with was ""Unforseen circumstances"". Normally I would be understanding of this, but three times is just unbelievable! Especially considering that due to this, I could not get a refill for my prescription before it ran out and went practically a week without my meds after only being on it for a month. Not to mention that your only source of communication through the app is a chat feature that could take anywhere up to 2 days to respond, and you can't even schedule an appointment until the notification pops up promoting you to do so. So if you feel you need an appointment quickly, good luck making one. I would say to anybody, take your money elsewhere and save yourself the headache. For an app that is meant to help people and provide somewhat of a safe space, they've really offered nothing but more frustration for me.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Edit: as of 9/14 I canceled my subscription. These people will not work with you to get your medication they prescribed. I WAS CONTACTING CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR 3 WEEK WITH NO POSITIVE RESULTS. For whatever reason they never gave me the option to mail it out despite it being their services gimmick. 4 request for updates later, giving 3+ business days each time, I got fed up. Potential users, please be aware, they won’t have your best mental health interest in mind and will make them worse. Emailing the person who responds on here is a joke and they are rudely blunt.

I was subscribed Prozac by my Cerebral prescriber on the 8/28. It is now 9/10 and I have yet to receive a prescription that said would take 3 days maximum. I wrote them 3 times so far with no resolve other then “did you want it to a local pharmacy or shipped?” Um. This service is supposed to allow you to buy your medications online, not once was I told or discussed a local pharmacy. I literally JUST want to buy the prescription they put me on. No one seems to be taking this seriously or looking into it. I’m definitely considering a credit card chargeback and canceling a service I really wanted and needed. Such a shame since they had glowing reviews. I’m convinced this company has no compassion for the people trying to seek help. Also, the care coordinator who responds to these bad reviews is the same responding in my app. They don’t care and it’s been weeks already. She isn’t helping.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up and was given the test for the wrong condition.  Later I had to ask to switch the care person out thrice due to the fact that the first one was male (I specified I wanted to work with a female counselor) the second person’s schedule didn’t work with mine, so I specified the hours a week I am available after which they assigned a new counselor who had no availability for the next 3 and a half weeks. When I mentioned this, I was assigned an appointment without being asked if it works for me. I then asked to cancel my membership and be refunded, due to the fact that I still hadn’t received the right test and also wasn’t able to schedule an appointment because of their unwillingness or inability to take my needs into consideration when setting me up with a care giver. I was then refunded 9 bucks out of the 30 I paid because due to policy they “don’t refund you wether you used a service or not”. For someone like me, who has never been in therapy it is a big deal to just sit down with a stranger and talk to them. So being treated like a number the same way you would be with any other subscription service is kind of alarming to me, considering they’re dealing with people’s mental health. In the end of the day all I can say is this, you get what you pay for, and if you have issues you should find someone who truly cares to help, and to whom you’re not just another subscriber on a platform.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I recently got an account with them to help manage my anxiety because I moved to a new state and don't know anyone, crashed my car, and need meds to function. They not only ditched my first video session and kept me waiting 35 mins before I hung up, but the next time I was on time but the microphone wasnt working so it took 3 mins out of our session so he said ""let's just reschedule"" even though there was 10 mins left of the session! He could've at least started to ask me basic questions but hung up. The 3rd time I tried connecting but the link wasn't working. I was in contact with all of them on the thread/messenger telling them what was going on and keeping them updated. I was suicidal going through ALOT of things and was telling them these things and I get a message that they cancelled my membership because I didn't answer their calls.... i didn't even know it was them until after I checked my RoboKiller app which shouldn't matter because I was constantly in contact with them while I was messaging them. They literally, I mean LITERALLY called me almost 10x daily. So if someone doesn't answer that much they get canceled? Most people who have anxiety and/or depression have problems talking about their issues in person. What they did was completely wrong. If i was suicidal that night and went to talk to them, I could've been dead. Cerebral, you disgust me. SCREW THIS APP!!!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The app listed an incorrect time zone for my appointments and when I showed up at the time listed, my provider did not. When I reached out the customer service representative relayed that my appointment was not at the time shown in the app but actually in a different time zone (which was also not the one I am in) and made it seem that I should have known this mistake when scheduling. I was then marked as having missed my appointment instead of it showing that my provider did not show up. I ultimately chose to cancel because the response I received was so frustrating and was told on the phone that I would be eligible for a refund due to the misunderstanding and the fact that I was unable to use the services because the app was giving me incorrect information. The agent on the phone was the only kind person I’ve spoken to at this company and she directed me to the online cancellation form. Then the customer service agent processing my request denied a refund saying that I was ineligible because my billing date had passed and I had missed my appointment. I explained in detail the issue I had and was again told it was my fault for missing the appointment. I have received nothing but additional stress from this app and they have taken zero accountability for the failings of their scheduling system. I would rate it 0 stars if I could. I would never recommend this app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This company has switched all of their salaried Therapists to private contractors. This means that all of their greatest therapists have fled to other jobs as their pay has been greatly diminished, and their benefits taken away. The app is finicky at best, and sometimes downright unusable. Their customer service number no longer has agents to speak to, and all correspondence with support must be done through e-mail. Stay away from this company at all costs.

*Update*
This company finally responded to my cancellation e-mail after nearly a week of waiting to hear from them. They also responded to this review below, rather generically, and didn’t offer any specific help. Their phone lines don’t actually have anyone to speak to, and they just request that you correspond through e-mail. The response that I received through e-mail was that I’m not eligible for a refund, even though I didn’t use the service during the month in which I’m requesting. The reason this is so frustrating is because I was told explicitly from a representative of their company that I’d get a refund, as long as I hadn’t used the service during the month of the request. Once this company has your money, they do not care about you. If you’re reading this, and considering starting service with them, please stay away from them at all costs. You will not be satisfied with them in the long run.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I signed up for a coaching plan and did one session. The coach was good and I was looking forward to talking with her again. Then I started receiving messages about prescriptions, which is not the plan I signed up for (because I don’t need a prescription). In one week, I received six messages (three emails and three texts) about scheduling an appt with my prescriber. I wrote to Cerebral each time, and I was told to “ignore” the messages and given various instructions about how to stop the messages. But the messages continued. Essentially, I was forced to interact with message about a prescription plan that I did not sign up to receive or agree to participate in. Although Cerebral reps assured me that I was on a coaching plan, the messages continued. It made me feel concerned for how my health records and data are being handled. That the company tried to put the responsibility on me to stop the messages is also concerning. I canceled my plan as a result and Cerebral has refused to issue a refund, citing policies rather than responding to my actual issues and concerns. After cancelation, I received five of the same email messages from what seems to be an auto responder.  Two stars are because the coach was good. Zero stars for the app and response to my concern for accurate health records and handling of my data.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This was a convenient option for getting meds while trying to locate a doctor with availability. The “therapist” you are supposed to see was not qualified or knowledgeable enough to help you work out any emotional issues or dig through trauma causing you to need help in the first place. I think the best she could do is send a “resource” which I never received. I stopped using this in March thinking that appointments needed to be kept to pay for the service, like when you see a doctor. Lo and behold, 4 months later I realized I was paying $85 per month every month (far more than the sign up rate) and hadn’t even logged in in 4 months. There was a family accident and I was not as attentive to these things as I should have been, being overwhelmed with other stressors and of course this is on me. The last one overdrafted my account while paying off copays the day before payday and I asked for at least the last $85 payment back, regardless of the fact that I had paid $85 for the last 3 months in addition and never used it. This was denied, so I am not sure that using cerebral made life any easier in the end. A regular psych and therapist is a far more affordable and effective option and many of them offer virtual AND take most insurance. Just putting that out there for anyone else who might be desperate and looking for help quickly.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was excited to finally start working on my mental health. I initially spoke to a psychiatrist and was prescribed antidepressants. Then I spoke to a counselor exactly one time. The app never worked, I was never assigned a care counselor, customer service was slow and mostly unhelpful, and isn't even addressing the issues I bring up in our emails. After starting me on antidepressants, no one ever followed up even one time to see how they were working for me. I spent a few hundred dollars and was given a script for 6 months, but now that I'm trying to move my remaining 3 refills to a local pharmacy, the script that truepill pharmacy provided only has a one month supply due to NY law. So I emailed and asked for the provider to forward the original script to my local pharmacy and they just said ""oh we are sorry can we offer you a discount?"" to which I told them I was disappointed they didn't even acknowledge the refill inquiry in the email. So now they sent their phone number. Its frustrating and i cannot imagine staying with a company with such subpar customer service in the mental health industry where attention and compassion are expected especially when there are a number of alternatives. I've switched to talkspace and it's been flawless. But I still need the remainder of the 3 months of meds I paid good money for and they're obviously in no rush to provide that.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This is a great idea especially for someone like me who has a fear of going to in person appointments. However, the Cerebral service is still full of bugs and is unfortunately NOT something that someone with actual anxiety or depression should pursue. Despite meeting with a medication specialist over two weeks ago and having my prescription approved, I have yet to receive my prescription in the mail nor have I received any tracking information for my medication. Instead, my medications have all been showing as “tracking information pending” for the past two and a half weeks . I gave the system some time and then reached out for some help. I was told my issue would be looked into, but I have never received a follow up. This was last week. I was forced today to message again. Not to mention my first therapy session, there were technical difficulties on the therapist side and we were forced to abandon the video call and resort to a phone call instead. This is NOT the service I have signed up for. I have already spent 125 dollars for two months of service and I have no medication and nothing to show for it. Pursue in person therapy instead. They are unresponsive when you have difficulties and they have done nothing but take my money and provide me with absolutely no care. Strong Recommendation to avoid this app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"The first few months with this service were awesome but from Dec ‘21 to March ‘22 I wasn’t able to pick up my prescription for ADHD meds - pharmacist told me it was on the providers end, cerebral provider told me everything was fine on their end. I ended up changing pharmacy and still had multiple week delays. I’ve just canceled my subscription because it was getting beyond ridiculous. 
Waste of money in the long run and cerebral won’t refund for the months where whatever issue it was prevented me from getting my meds, because the “service was provided” because I attended the online appointments. They don’t seem to understand that that an appointment is only one small part, and as I was using it exclusively for adhd medication, which I wasn’t able to pick up due to their/their providers failure, they in fact did not provide services and I feel I should be refunded for those months. 
Imagine if you went to a restaurant, ordered a nice meal, which you never got and then they just gave you the check, because you spoke to the server and that’s apparently the same thing as actually getting the meal… 

3 days after canceling my subscription, I was also charged double my normal monthly fee and I’m still waiting for half of it to be returned….",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I canceled my subscription back in February of 2021 after months of being unsatisfied. I had never once felt cared about, my “care team” felt completely robotic, I was NEVER taken seriously.  So, I followed all the steps to cancel my account, couldn’t log back into it and thought everything was settled.. turns out, I was continually being charged still, without my knowledge, or any notification of any kind until December 2021!!  Then they gave me the run around and played the blame game, I was promised my problem would be resolved but it never has been.  You know, for a company that is supposed to CARE about people, THEY DON’T.  Once I got that startling email about charges to my card I logged into my account and saw I had several messages from my “care counselor ”, I never responded, for MONTHS, but somehow they couldn’t figure out that something was, you know, off?  “Hey maybe we should try a little harder to contact her and see if everything is ok?”.   I had to file a dispute with my bank and cancel my card to get my money back and keep them from stealing more.  They are still trying to charge my card.  I have once again gone through the cancelation process, nothing.  All I have gotten from this site is more stress, anxiety and a further distrust or medical personnel.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"When I signed up for cerebral I chose the medication + therapy option because I was really excited to meet with a therapist (I specifically wanted someone with a PsyD or PhD, which they made seem like would be available with this option). I chose the more expensive option for this purpose. I then fill out my information to find that there are ONLY 2 therapists in my state on the app and that neither of them have availability that works for me and neither of them are PhDs or PsyDs. I was a little bummed, but I thought ""no big deal, I will just switch to care counselor + medication"". So I immediately emailed telling them about what happened and they said they would not refund me the difference between care counselor + medication and therapy + medication. Even though I did not use any of the therapy services and I emailed them immediately. They are in it for the money, 100%. They would rather lose me as a customer and keep my extra cash than make things right by letting me switch my membership and continue to be a customer. I am appalled with this company that claims to care about mental health. I asked my customer service representative if I could speak to a supervisor about this issue and have been ghosted for 3 days. Do not trust this service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I am only giving this app an extra star right now because it did help me to find a medication that worked for me. The service on the other hand is awful. I am using this for ADHD and was prescribed a non stimulant antidepressant with a side effect that helps some people to focus. It’s been a game changer. However, 3 months ago my prescriber left the app and I had to wait 3 months to get in with anyone else. Luckily my old prescriber had given me 3 months of meds so I was ok with that. In the meantime I still had to see a care counselor once a month. The last 3 appointments she had either not showed or there was technical difficulty (the woman lives in an RV in the dessert, not even joking) and the other 2 she didn’t show up at all. When she does show up she reads the same questions off a screen every single time. Same exact questions. Anyway my apt with the new prescriber comes. She doesn’t show up. I reschedule for the next day, no big deal, and she cancels on me. So now I’m going to have a huge gap with no medication and am going to have to go through withdrawal because of their incompetent staff. In my opinion, don’t waste your money on this one. There are other apps out there that offer the same service for a better price.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This service was great in the beginning. Then a few months in, it wasn’t. This was fraud and a farce. Monthly payments to speak to someone at inconvenient times months apart. Care councilor only ever asked me if my medication was working. She spent the entire 30 minutes on that one question and typing. She would ask me the same questions about my medication in that same session over and over. After a while, I stopped attending. My opinion is she was multitasking. She was definitely working on other things as 30 minutes to type a one sentence response for that same question is ridiculous. Actually, the one time I was sobbing and  needed to talk she was unfazed and cold and told me I had 15 minutes left so I never opened up to her again. I only kept cerebral this long because of my medication but then I stopped receiving those too. I haven’t seen a bottle of medication in about 8 weeks. Last refill was December 9th and it’s February 2nd. Once your class action suits begin, I will gladly be joining them. This is fraud and someone is eventually going to do something about it. Daily Mail did an entire article about the Cerebral being A scam a mere month. More and more people are catching up on the garbage this is.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,After shopping around for a couple of days I saw how highly rated Cerebral was a decided to give them a try. I signed up for the service because I had to speak to someone ASAP. I signed up and completed the forms and right away received errors messages when scheduling an appointment with a provider. The site lists so many possible options and I selected different times about one month out. The same message appeared saying that the time is no longer available. I spoke to CS. the next day and they scheduled the appointment. Unfortunately the provider never showed up to the zoom. I received a call from CS 30 minutes after the scheduled call notifying me that the provider cannot make the call and will reschedule. That information would have been useful ahead of time. The time the prolonged frame that everything happened is very inconvenient along with the lack of notice. If you are looking to speak to someone within the week. This is NOT WORTH IT. Get help somewhere else. When a 100% refund is requested they do not take accountability for the lack of rendering services and hide behind apologies and only continue to state they are a subscription model.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"The care counselors and some providers are super helpful and sweet. They helped a lot with learning new management skills for anxiety and depression. Well, mostly just the care counselor. However, my meds were constantly off schedule and arriving late or early. If you miss an appointment they won’t refill them for you (which is a huge part of why i get them sent to my door, i constantly miss appointments and can’t get to an in person place for them) and i was going on and off meds left and right. now i’ve been unmediated for two weeks before i finally saw that they aren’t sending out any refills before another appointment. That’s fine- just would’ve been nice to be told that two weeks prior. 
If and when you decide to cancel, they make it almost impossible. Since i’ve already done the digging- don’t try in the app, don’t try through the providers or counselors or anything, they won’t do it over the phone, and your only option is an email and hope they see it in a reasonable time and don’t try to give you the go around about canceling. for me, this service is great until it just really isn’t. wouldn’t do it again over the frustration of the last year.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"It’s expensive. If you want everything they offer you’re looking at 325 a month. It was way too expensive and I personally wasn’t getting a lot out of it. I tried to cancel and they don’t make it easy. You have to send a request to a cancel e-mail. Then you have to wait two weeks? In that time, I’ve been constantly harassed about paying a 325 dollar bill when the whole reason I cancelled was that I couldn’t afford it. No one can talk to me directly or send me an actual invoice. They will just send you to an FAQ or rehash how to properly cancel. Feels borderline like a scam. Here is an service that’s supposed to help people with anxiety, stress and other mental help issues causing undo stress and anxiety. Never going to any service like this again. 

If you need an app like this because you can’t go to a doctor in person, make sure you read the fine print and work with someone on the billing. It feels predatory. The therapists are nice and knowledgeable. It’s the app and the customer service side that’s predatory. 

If you can go to a mental health professional in person, you will be much better off dealing with an actual, professional receptionist who can provide payment options and spell out terms of service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Once you purchased the subscription you take a test and then go to the appointment screen however there were no appointments available. I had to contact support and we went back and forth. I explained the problem and they would send me a generic article on how to reschedule. I had to explain that the problem was a lack of available appointments 3 times before they actually helped me.  Then once I had my first appointment it was the day before my subscription was set to renew. The first month was basically waisted because they had no available appointments. The next month was even worse, I tried making an appointment right after my first appointment was over but the whole month had already been blocked out. I had to contact support again and again they sent me the same generic article about rescheduling appointments. I was so frustrated I just stopped replying. 
In all honesty this app feels like a scam. In their terms of services they state that there are no refunds even if the services is not used do to lack of appointments. Which means they KNOW that they don’t have the workers needed to run the app correctly. They shouldn’t take on more clients if they can’t offer us the service they’re advertising!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I was really excited to try this method of therapy out. I don’t really have a lot of time to do in person therapy and the thought of just being able to message my therapist sounded awesome. It also sounded convenient to be able to have meds available if needed. However, as I was setting up my account, my therapist that was “customized and personally selected based off of my needs” was not. And I get it, can’t always get what you want, but my biggest request was that I did not feel comfortable having a male therapist. Unfortunately that was the only choice they gave me. Customer support was actually quite helpful when I reached out to them asking if I could change therapists, but apparently there was only one therapist for my entire state and it was a male, so I didn’t have any other choices for therapists. This unfortunately was a major deal breaker for me. I completely understand the shortage in mental health workers, however, it was frustrating to put my money into a subscription before finding this out, and ultimately a waste of my money. I feel like this kind of information should be disclosed before people invest their time and money in this program.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Cerebral tells you that it’s affordable therapy, but what you’re actually paying for is a care provider (and medicine if you chose to). If you want to see a license therapist through cerebral, you have to pay a few hundred dollars, just like every other therapy app. Due to hard times I was unable to pay for my monthly subscription. I knew this ahead of time and emailed cerebral to cancel my subscription (there is no other way to cancel). Cerebral cancelled my subscription, but not until two days after I was suppose to pay for this month’s subscription. When I had gotten my last check from my last job, Cerebral took out my monthly subscription payment. When I contacted someone about it, they told me that my account would be cancelled after this month. I needed that money to pay other more important bills and rent. Cerebral also cancelled my appointments I had this month, so now I am paying a monthly subscription for absolutely nothing in return. This is literally a robbery. Cerebral falsely advertises and has super fine print in their contracts. Please do yourself a favor and go use BetterHelp. I used to use them and they are so much better. They are more expensive but if you can afford it, it’s so worth it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"So I used BetterHelp and found my therapist on there, they gave me a full refund no problem. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist on this app only for them not to show up or say anything about not showing up, they didn’t even cancel. I cancel my second appointment and the next one isn’t for another 2-3 weeks and I can’t change prescribers easily. There’s no option on the app to look into someone else. I contact support to either refund my first month since I got absolutely nothing out of it or refund this month since I JUST got charged and couldn’t afford it. In which the first representative told me to cancel my subscription and they’d look into it and contact me. I get a response telling me they offer absolutely no refunds, which the previous rep didn’t mention at all. That you have to cancel before you get charged. This app is out to make profit off of people with mental health issues more than it is to help us. This just caused me more unnecessary stress because I couldn’t just get a small amount of money in their pool back. I recommend BetterHelp for therapy because they’ll work with you and refund your money if needed. They don’t offer psychiatry but I found a great therapist. This app is trash.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I feel I got what I needed from the service and decided to move on to something different. I was on the $85 monthly plan. It was difficult to schedule counseling sessions - sometimes the next available appointment was months out. When canceling, you must email cerebral. I received confirmation, but continued to get notifications about scheduling appointments. I followed up with an email to again confirm that my subscription was canceled. I was informed I would no longer receive notifications and my policy was indeed canceled. The following month I see a charge for $85. My account says deactivated and I even deleted my payment information, so I’m very confused why I’m still being charged. I’ve replied to the emails and I’m currently in a back and forth phone call situation with a lovely customer service rep who doesn’t seem to have the support she needs. She’s told me a refund is on the way, but that there may have been a glitch where several former members were continuing to be charged. She seems to be trying to get to the bottom of it, but the emails she’s sending me are not coming through. I hope they figure this out and I hope I actually get my refund. Will update if necessary.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,When I started the service it gave me a lot of hope. I felt well taken care of. The medication prescribed to me was helpful. My doctor was skeptical but I went ahead anyway. My insurance is not great and this was the most affordable option for me as our family has a limited budget. The app was somewhat confusing and appointments were consistent with one provider (medication) but not the counselor. People were switched on me and I felt uncomfortable. Appointments were only available via the scheduling tool months out. The app continually logged me out so I would miss notifications and communications. I decided to cancel the service since all I was getting was medication and my doctor is willing to prescribe it to me. I followed their protocol and canceled well before the next billing cycle. I was charged anyway. I emailed several times asking for information and to be refunded with one response completely ignoring my request and radio silence thereafter. I called and the service said it had to be done via email but I waited for a representative who was able to finally get the refund. I began looking at other reviews and realized that this is common.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"No matter how desperate or broke you think you are to get help, I promise you this will make it worse. It $89 a month, meds were $50 a month out of pocket, ZERO customer service, the worst “care team”, and never reliable. They would go a week or 2 without getting back to me about filling medication (that is beyond evil). One time my medication was out so I messaged them to refill. No response. Then after 5 days of me asking what is going on, they said “oh you need a video call with the therapist- here’s her calendar”. Her calendar wasn’t even open! I messaged again and told them, they finally got back a few days later with someone else’s calendar. So I made an appointment and this chick had no idea even why I was having an appointment with her. She said okay I’ll fill your prescription. She NEVER DID. Beyond frustrating. I asked them March 27, it is now  April 7 and I still have not heard a word from them. Oh except Caleb R. Has definitely messaged me and said “we’re working hard to get this done for you”. I am convinced this Caleb character is not a real human at all. 
 Save up and find a psychiatrist in your area or through Zocdoc PLEASE. I don’t want another human to go through the torture of this trash app again.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Was charged for three months before even finishing registration, when calling back asking for a refund on my money for services I never used or even had access to, was given a run around by customer service. The woman emailing me tried to lie to me about what was in their terms of service even after I pointed out multiple times that according to their billing policy I am still eligible for a refund. She tried insisting that even though registration was never completed, because I started registration I could still be billed even without verification of my ID along with payment information. All they had was my name typed out and a card number. She tried to tell me the professionals need payment for being “available” to provide me services even tho I did not use or have access to them, what does that even mean? I was not registered. I did eventually get my refund, however the fact that she would try to lie like I cannot access the terms for myself and then continue to dodge my questions and direct quotes from the terms was ridiculous. If somebody else were to not push as hard and were in my situation they would have definitely just been robbed of over $200.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up with my insurance and took the next step to help myself. It took about a month to even see a prescriber and just a prescriber. No therapist or anything. I mentioned this to their costumer help center and they offered me a refund for the first month, but no mention as to when I’d see a therapist. After I met with my prescriber, she immediately prescribed me mood stabilizers without getting to know anything about me. Just a few simple questions and that was enough to prescribe medicine which is another red flag. I asked her when I would see my therapist next and she got flustered and started making things up. She said someone would follow up with me after this session ended and even then she sounded unsure. Which no one did and I had to reach out and ask. When I did ask, they told me that they didn’t have any therapist for my insurance and instead I could pay almost 300 a month to talk to someone. I waited 2 and 1/2 months to be told this and I wasn’t my time and money for pills I didn’t even want. This system is super frustrating and I wouldn’t recommend. They made it seemed that with my insurance it should be easy and available but I was stupid enough to believe it. Thanks.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Update: Don’t try this app. They truly are thieves the only thing I could get back was 30% of all the money I lost on them. Really not worth it, I already struggle with anxiety and their service doesn’t make it any easier. Please if you’re seeking for help DO NOT USE THIS APP! It’s not worth it, they take advantage of our situations. Just the fact that they won’t give you a refund regardless of the situation is enough reason. Please don’t fall for it like me. :( 

I usually don’t write reviews, but I’m really upset. Everything was going great with cerebral until I wanted to cancel my subscription because I couldn’t afford it any longer. While I was trying to figure out how to cancel I accidentally clicked on one of the other subscriptions, and it automatically charged me 240$. It didn’t even asked for permission, and it surely didn’t say how much it was. I didn’t agree to make that payment in any way. And when I emailed them about the situation they told me I couldn’t get a refund. It is really upsetting because I didn’t even want to have that subscription, I didn’t know how much it was, it was merely a mistake. And I also emailed them immediately after what happened. It’s so frustrating!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I paid for the service. I checked everything throughout the process to ensure I’d be able to receive care/prescriptions in my state (PA). I received multiple errors telling me my intake was incomplete because when I went to schedule with a provider, it would opt me back to the login. After a long hold because no one responded via email in a timely manner, I finally got someone who told me it’s not working because I can’t receive care in my area. I told them I checked and the lists of states that don’t allow care/prescriptions online did not include my state. I was told it wasn’t for ADHD, it was for bipolar. They cancelled my subscription but won’t refund me for a service I couldn’t use. When I was finally responded to about it, they told me they’d refund me $4 but I agreed to terms of the subscription whether the services were utilized or not. I wanted to utilize the service. I was told I couldn’t. And nowhere did they list they can’t help bipolar in PA. Rip-off. Cruel to take advantage of someone who read great reviews and wanted to finally get help when everywhere in my area will take months. Guess it’s better to wait than trust a sketchy app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Only way I have been able to create/login/access my cerebral account is by using a web browser session.  

The app never has worked, from day one.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app countless times.  Have tried many different days and times of day over a roughly 3-week period.  The app will always initially open up to the login screen.  I always enter my correct credentials and then no matter what, the app always just goes to a solid white screen and stays there indefinitely.  It’s like it is trying to process the login request or something and it just gets stuck there.  

I am incredibly surprised to see such a promising service offer such a horrible and malfunctioning app on the Apple App Store.  Especially considering the amount of money this company has spent on its marketing efforts.  I saw this companies adds many, many times over the last 4-6 months on a variety of platforms ranging from social media, to music streaming services, to video streaming services.  Really would have expected it to at least have its app fully functional before it went so hard to the market trying to acquire clients.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,The service is trash and not worth the money. The appointments are rushed and counselors and prescribers all seemed bored and annoyed when I asked questions or spoke at all. My counselor only responded to message every other day and because of this when she sent my medication to the wrong place 4 times in a row the delay time to actually receive it took over 2 weeks because of the slow communication. I was prescribed 3 medications and was charged extra for the medication which I thought was included in the price. I know other members of cerebral with the same medications and no health insurance just like me but they didn’t have to ever pay extra so I’m not sure why I did every month. And when I asked these questions went unanswered as did most of my questions about the service. Also you only get monthly meetings with are about 15 minutes with a counselor which is ridiculous and you can only meet with your prescriber every 3 months so why is every month charged the same when all of the services are not available every month. I was a member for 5 months just to give some clarity. I tried to give them a chance.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was marketed to Cerebral because they “help with adhd.” I have struggled my whole life with severe symptoms. All assessments rank the symptoms high for me. They made me feel misunderstood. Put me on Zoloft which made symptoms worse for adhd. Was told to set alarms and get a planner. I signed up for meds in the mail and they didn’t deliver them on time so I went off cold Turkey for two days. My second counseling appointment was a no show to “technical issues” of which I had no communication from anyone on my “care team” about so I cancelled. It took them over 24 hours to get my meds ordered when I told them I had never received them. So the chat anytime feature, takes them a long time to reply. Having anxiety and being stressed about an appointment only to sit in the video room and your therapist never shows up… on top of paying a lot of money, just made my mental health worse. Top it off, they won’t refund me because my care appointment was the day before my billing cycle. I never got the appointment and I have to throw away $85 for a service I won’t be using. Clearly mental health isn’t on their priority list as much as taking your money is. Nice!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I do not feel the prescribers on this app are equipped to prescribe for anything other than generalized depression. I am bipolar and deal with PTSD and my experience with cerebral has been very poor. I understand this app is NOT a replacement for an actual psych but I’ve been taking the same medication for 10+ years, how hard can it be to get refills? It seems like every 6 months, my medicine is not correctly sent to the pharmacy or there’s some kind of miscommunication it isn’t even sent! Rule number one for anti depressants is NEVER stop them cold turkey. Well, I’ve had to twice now because of lack of communication between cerebral and multiple pharmacies. You cannot actually speak to your prescriber when an error like this occurs so your “care counselor” has to report to them which can take days! And even then, even if they get through to them, you get a “they’ll get back to you”. This app, in theory, sounds great but in my opinion, it falls shorts and when dealing with medication, you cannot afford to fall short.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I truly do not understand how this app is running honestly. Nothing presented is true. I had met with a prescriber and during that conversation she said she would prescribe me with Prozac and it would be there in a couple days, all this good stuff. A couple days later I went into my portal and I could not see the prescriber on my account anymore nor did I have any medications prescribed to me. A couple days after that I had a meeting with a therapist, she basically took the entire 30 minutes reassuring me the medication is coming and then said I was prescribed Zoloft. I found that extremely odd. A couple more days pass and I still have nothing so I sent a message through the chat and the only response I got was asking if I wanted it mailed or pick it up at the pharmacy. Now a week later, still no actual response, I ended my services. I don’t have any time to waste when it comes to my mental health and this app is absolutely disgusting for doing this to anybody. It is extremely traumatic to have a “therapist “ let alone an entire team of them use you and make promises they never keep. I would never recommend this app to anybody.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This program left my mental health worse than when I began. I could never connect with a therapist. When I reached out to support for help finding someone that may be able to work with my schedule, support informed me that no one in my area had hours that would work. Next the prescriber I met with refused to fill the medication I have been currently taking because “we were not meeting in person” and cut my dosing in half despite me expressing how deeply I have been struggling. She informed me to go to the hospital if it was really as bad as I was claiming. If Cerebral is marketed as an easy virtual mental health  program then why would the prescribers working for Cerebral penalize patients care because of meeting virtually? It’s not a great sign for a mental health company when talking to their prescriber causes a panic attack. Severely disappointed with Cerebral would be putting it nicely. It was a complete waste of my money since support gave up responding to my requests and I was never able to schedule with a therapist. Sad when you are feeling desperate for help and only get taken advantage of.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I decided to try Cerebral after struggling to find an available therapist in my area. The care counselor I ended up with was sitting on a living room couch talking to someone else in the room in the middle of our first appointment. An office or quiet room without other people/disturbances would be a nice level of professionalism to uphold. The UI for this app is a joke. One single message thread for contacting all of your providers. I was told to contact my prescriber and they were not even shown as part of the message conversation, so I had no way of contacting them. I was told to schedule my next appointment before availability fills up and there was no way to do so within the app. Apparently you are able to schedule only when it prompts you to do so. How, as a telehealth app, can you not have appointment scheduling as a functioning feature? You had one job. After a week or so going back and forth with support they offered to schedule an appointment for me. At this point I cancelled and asked for a refund for the month which I could not even schedule using their app. This service is complete garbage.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"When I went to sign up for Cerebral, there was a technical error with the app. After that was dealt with, there was a technical issue with the calendar in the app. It wasn’t allowing me to schedule anything with a prescriber. Then, there was another technical issue that prevented me from scheduling with a care coordinator. My prescriber was wonderful to talk to but then prescribed my medication in a way that my insurance didn’t accept. I tried to contact him immediately to let him know, but there’s no way to send a note to your prescriber that you need a prescription update. I tried to send a message to my care coordinator but the messaging system inside the app is also broken. 

Absolutely nothing in this app has functioned correctly for me since the moment I started. It’s been a very frustrating experience. When I told them about the technical issue, they told me to clear my cache, update my phone, or change browsers, so they have no idea what’s wrong with the app. 

If things get resolved quickly I might change my review but so far this has been a very poor experience overall.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"There’s so many issues not only with the app but with the team of “experts”. I had originally switched from my original mental health provider to save time and money, however it is not worthy it. You get what you pay for, it’s cheap because you get cheap customer service. My emotional support team was not supportive at all instead they were condescending towards me reaching out regarding issues about my prescription and made it seem like I was trying to get extra medication… my prescription was lost by FedEx (highly recommend not using the prescription delivery service as well, the do not actually require or show you a signature so when it says “delivered” there’s no telling if it was or not). So getting extra medication was definitely not the case. Receiving a response from your prescriber is extremely slow and frustrating because they are not responsive. All of this is horrible when you are going through personal struggles and struggles at work because your lack of medication is affecting your performance. Please, read the reviews and save yourself some frusteation.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I reached out to cerebral during a crisis of trying to mentally recover from a domestic violence situation that was ongoing, and quickly escalating. I chose therapy and medication because I felt that I needed both. My counselor was great, I would have loved to have stayed with her. My prescriber was scheduled to have a visit with me for the first time and just out of the blue cancelled it. I called and explained to them how bad I needed this and begging for her to give me my appointment back. Only to find out, she’d already given it to someone else. I guess their money spends better than mine. Rescheduled the appt with JACKIE DIXON, and she called me by different patients name throughout the video visit that wasn’t working. This was odd because my visit with my counselor worked great. We continued the session over the phone, she said she was prescribing 2 medications and I begged for weeks for answers as to where my prescriptions were. I was never prescribed anything. My domestic violence escalated to my fiancé committing suicide, and I had to go elsewhere to find treatment to keep myself from going off the deep end. Waste of money, waste of time.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Update 2: I never received any services for my 2nd month, cancelled and asked for a refund, but Cerebral support’s Angelo D. rejected it. This is a subscription model, so even if they don’t give you any services, you will still be charged. Biggest waste of money ever!

 Update 1: This is my update after about a month. I was excited to find an online service to get my medication. And I enjoyed talking with my care providers for the initial sessions, but it’s been downhill from there. My providers don’t seem to listen to my needs as they’ve sent out way more medication than I said I needed. At least I got it in a timely fashion. I just don’t feel listened to and my care provider even canceled my second session last minute. Which is fine, stuff happens. However, the next available appointment is more than a month from now. With the prescriber, 2 months. Talking with your health professionals this infrequently with a monthly subscription service isn’t right. The app is almost unusable as well. Can’t book appointments or complete your tasks. Not worth the 85 a month in my opinion. I’m ending my subscription.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I got this app because I don’t have insurance and desperately need care for my mental health. At first everything seemed to be going great, I was easily going to get my medication and therapy at an affordable rate. My prescriber said she’d have my pills delivered probably by midweek the next week and when they didn’t come i reached out to my care team. They tried to send them to a pharmacy (which would have been great had I actually had insurance) since I couldn’t afford them I asked to expedite them they said they’d reach out to my prescriber and get back to me. Two days later no response. I contact them again and this time alert them I am completely out of medication and they say the same thing. I just received a message two days after that last contact saying my prescriber can’t actually prescribe my medication because SHES NOT EVEN LICENSED IN MY STATE. They recommend people when you join and recommended me someone who cannot even prescribe me medication. Im going to unfortunately have to stick with this app for a while until I get insurance. I do not feel cared for or respected by any degree.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"My plan was covered under insurance. I inquired about changing plans and was told by the Cerebral care coordinator that the cost was the same; no additional charges. She walked me through how to change my plan then, boom, nearly $400 in charges. 

For several days I messaged the care coordinator to ask what was going on. I screenshot the chat thread and showed her what she originally said. I called and left voice messages. I emailed as well. I finally received a response but it did not acknowledge or correct the error. A care coordinator finally told me that my insurance wasn’t applied to the transaction. 

It wasn’t until I asked to cancel my plan that they were willing to admit the error and agree to process the $400 refund. I decided to  go through with canceling my plan because of the mixup. It took two weeks to go through the many hoops to cancel my plan, and just as long if not longer to receive an actual refund of the $400 mishap. I never received a refund for the original service fee. It was clunky, not well integrated, very stressful. Just all the things you DONT want from a mental health care app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I started at cerebral because I thought if I was in network it would only cost 30/month but it’s actually just an convoluted as using insurance for any mental health care. 

Cerebral is only required to send bills to your insurance every three months (trust me I called a million times and tried getting them to send them earlier but they were no help). After they finally submitted I had already seen my provider four times and am now responsible for four appointment costs which will vary for everyone. I have UHC and the contracted rate was 140/appt. So in total it is 170/appt… same as all the other places. 

Cost asside - super hard to talk with your doctor because you have a “coordinator” who may or may not be able to get ahold of your doctor. So many technical glitches with their system (b/c “they are a startup”?) that I received a couple of my months free because it was THAT bad. Was super understanding about all of this until I was gouged at the cost… now I’m moving on and just disappointed in all of these good reviews because I don’t see how this set up works for anyone….",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"UPDATE: this is a scam. I’ve been fighting with reps to be refunded, as they never allowed access to the service I subscribed to. My provider no showed my appointment, and somehow I’m getting blamed for it. Talking to “support” gets you nowhere. No resolved tickets. No actual access to mental health services. absolutely avoid this “service”

 It’s absolutely unethical to claim to provide access to mental health support and then steal our money.

 I’ve been a member since January, have managed to get only 1 20 minute appointment. Their schedule system lists appointments as open when they aren’t and you have to guess your way through the calendar to find one that works. The message function has never worked for me and I keep getting messages to schedule an appointment with a care counselor but when I try to schedule the app says I haven’t been assigned one. Every time I use this app I have to put in a support ticket for its basic functions. I’ve spent $200 on mental support that has been not only non existent, but is actively making things harder. You’re not saving money here.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was extremely dissatisfied with the services I received from Cerebral. I did not feel cared for or monitored in the slightest. The provider barely spoke to me and just threw meds at me. The process after that was an unorganized disaster. I was experiencing nightly severe panic attacks that did not allow me to sleep for longer than 3-4 hours a night and had to wait over a month to receive my prescribed as needed anxiety meds. When I did receive them, they were not the correct medication. Cerebral then sent my prescription to my local pharmacy where I was told I would have to pay over $80 to pick them up. I did not feel as though I was in the hands of people who cared in the slightest for my well being. I had a meeting with a therapist who was lovely and very helpful, but other than that the service was basically a nightmare and honestly hindered my mental health more than helped it. The low quality of “treatment” I received was quite frankly irresponsible. I would highly advise anybody considering this service to try to find ANY other way to receive mental health treatment.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"It’s already difficult finding medical care providers in-person as a new patient. I was pretty excited at first….however my experiences had not been the best with Cerebral. Please note, this is my first time ever writing a review. 

The Care Coordinators don’t respond until like 3-4 days late. Not easily accessible. It was great when they were able to switch me with a better prescriber, but then they canceled on me telling me that the ONLY prescriber who can help me in my network is no longer available. This is Pennsylvania we’re talking about…the ONLY one that could help according to my medication needs in my network has been changed to another department - Marisa Savic. This is so disappointing as I feel like I wasted money for no service at all. It feels like a scam. I’m just gonna keep doing my research and find an actual in-person medical provider. This is the second remote medical app I’ve attempted to get help from and it both failed me. Folks, you’re better off asking your insurance to help you find a mental health specialist. Hope everyone continue or start to heal with their mental health.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I purchased the promo $27 package. I was at a moment that I can use someone to speak to. The same day within 30minutes or purchasing the app I opted in for the support and paid the $114 additional. I booked my appointment and the therapist was a no show. Call the support lines and nothing. At this point I felt that this app was not worth the money I had just spent $141 for an app I read off “helpful” tips from? Yeah I have google for that. I called to cancel I submitted my cancellations forms etc all with the same day. Moments of purchasing actually. All they cared was to keep my money and not offer support. They cancelled my membership and stated they can not refund me because “we have to pay everyone that was available to support you while you had the membership. I had the “membership” or package whatever for only a few hours. The therapist was a no show and no one ever got back to me about support or to help me through fixing the issue. So who really was available? You only care about the money. I paid $140 to have an app for a few hours. Nice.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was given a charge for medication of 30 dollars, two months before I was due for medication. I contacted support immediately and requested they CANCEL the order but they didn’t. They did an investigation that lasted a week, and did not cancel medication. They said the pharmacy switched to a 90 day because of insurance purposes. They told me I couldn’t receive a refund or return the medication even though it was THEIR MISTAKE! If they had listened to me and cancelled the order like I had asked to it wouldn’t have been shipped to me.  I’m extremely upset about this because I’ve been purposefully trying to save money, I’m obviously struggling with my mental health and the fact they didn’t listen to me and took so long to confirm the information I had given them (I had even provided them with pictures of the prescription labels and they still had to call the pharmacy). It was a complete hassle and completely unnecessary on their part. And you can’t cancel instantly you have to //email them to cancel//, and I have done so. I wish I could get all the money I spent back.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Without the therapy option, you are paying $85 a month just for prescription services which are slightly more convenient but way more expensive than just seeing a traditional doctor or psychologist occasionally to get the medication you need. What makes me dislike this company the most is the difficulty it takes to cancel your subscription. You cannot cancel online or in the app, you have to email them and wait for them to get back to you. This to me is an unethical practice that takes advantage of people who are already struggling with mental health and may avoid or forget to go through these extra steps and waste a bunch of money on this service even if it is not helping them. There is no reason they cannot allow you to cancel more easily, they just make it more difficult on purpose so they can make money off of people who fail to cancel when they otherwise would like to. For this reason I would never trust this company or use them again and I would not recommend it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Unless you have money to burn, this service is a GAMBLE: They do not offer refunds under any circumstances. Is your situation asking for a refund a special circumstance? Did you not use their service yet before cancelling? Too bad, because after they have told you there are no refunds, they will BLOCK your email from further support tickets so you can’t say anything else.
For mental health, money is important. You NEED money for mental health services and medication. Not only is it bad business practice not to give refunds, it’s dangerous to do this as a mental health service. This is money that could have been used to help in another way and that is taken away if Cerebral doesn’t help or it is not as expected. If this were a good service, they would not have to give so many refunds, and it seems like they already have their protocol down with blocking my email from further discussion about it, which also tells me it must happen a lot. Instead of playing with your mental health, just find something you are confident will work for you.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This app is cheap and not worth it. They never stated during the sign up process that payment without insurance would accumulate to 325 DOLLARS A MONTH. Well I guess shame on me for not fully reading their “terms and conditions” while suffering and struggling to find help while in the midst of a mental health crisis. I only had two therapy sessions, pointless ones at that. And had one refill of medication adding up to 25 dollars. When I realized 325 dollars had been snuck out of my account, mind you I only work part time and I’m 21 years old (325 dollars is a big chunk out of my income) if I KNEW I would be paying this much I would have NEVER signed up for this piece of crap scam of a therapy service. I called, trying to get an understanding of how my minimal services added up to such an amount when I’d only used it for two weeks. They refused to give me a refund after two days of going back and forth and being told to wait. I canceled my subscription and was left in even more distress than when I started using it. So frankly, screw you cerebral!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"So this was my first time seeking help and, wow, no wonder people have trouble reaching out. I was hoping to get help with anxiety/depression and to get tested for ADHD. My provider seemed to think I was only interested in getting adderall or another stimulant, even though I stated I wasn’t sure about even wanting medication if I did have adhd. According to her adhd is only diagnosed in childhood and if I did have it I would’ve been diagnosed by now. I simply wanted to start the process of getting some help with these things because it’s affecting my daily life and felt completely dismissed by her. She brushed aside my feelings about struggling with daily tasks and said it was “normal”. She also stated that my difficulty with focusing on school and school work was “a lack of motivation”. She then proceeded to tell me that if I tried to go to another provider that they would obviously drug test me and I would have to do further testing for adhd (which would be fine); loved being lectured for 30 minutes like I was just drug seeking. She didn’t even talk to me about my anxiety or depression…🙃",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"The only reason I still use this service is because I’ve built a relationship with my therapist. The app itself lacks functionality and the care coordinators who work essentially as customer service reps, have never once been helpful. There was one instance when I couldn’t get an appointment for 2 months with my prescriber and I told the care coordinator, who did nothing to help me schedule an appointment sooner (this happened while I was having a bad reaction to a medication and NEEDED a meeting with them to get it resolved). The app itself also lacks functionality. Lastly, cerebral has recently changed payment processors, and sent only one email notification for this with no deadline for when my payment information needed to be updated, and I found out that my account had been suspended due to this. I am super frustrated but feel stuck using this service because of the knowledge and background that my therapist has. It is unfortunate.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was hopeful about this service given the wait for most providers. For full transparency, I don’t know what care looks like because I never received it. I had two different clinicians reschedule last minute and one no showed. I had also waited an hour right after sign up to meet with someone but no luck. Things happen and it’s totally reasonable to expect rescheduling, however given I was waiting for an initial meeting with a prescriber there was no effort made to see whether delaying my appointment would also mean I would run out of my medication from a prior provider. Had I known the expected wait to see a provider was 1-2 months, I could plan accordingly. This was not the case. As a clinical psychologist, I am very familiar with what standard care looks like and I 
can say what I experienced was NOT that. I hope that others have a better experience for the sake of their care. Although it’s a pain, I suggest going through your insurance or looking at private practice therapists if you have anything beyond mild symptoms.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’ve used Cerebral for a few months now. At first it was great because I was able to speak to a provider fast about medications. Now it is entirely disappointing and the app is practically useless. Every time I've reached out to get refills of my prescriptions I cannot reach the provider directly and the care team constantly says all my medications were sent to my pharmacy when in reality only one or two were and so it takes days to get a response and to get my medications refilled. Same with if I have a question for my provider regarding side effects or changes, I cannot speak to them directly and it has to go through the care team and takes forever to get a response, and sometimes I have not gotten any clear response at all. The app is useless in these regards, it’s just a messaging system at this point. Ive also had my appointments with care team members rescheduled so many times now it’s hard to keep track. I am so frustrated with this service it’s pushed me to now switch services.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I started cerebral a couple months ago because I have issues with severe anxiety and depression and was quite sure I am adhd. At first it was helpful. I met with a provider and a care counselor within a couple days of signing up and I was started on medication. Then I had issues getting my care Counselor to join the video calls but I was getting notified that I was missing my appointments even though I signed on and waited in the waiting room for no one to show up. I notified cerebral and they apologized and offered to assign me a new counselor and asked me some questions about what I was looking for in a counselor, then never proceeded to assign a new one. So I’ve wasted payments because I’m not even getting what I paid for which honestly DOES NOT help anxiety and depression because I know feel horrible guilty because I’m a stay at home mom so that money could have gone towards something else that would have been beneficial to my family. Don’t  use cerebral, they’ll just take advantage of you and take your money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"From beginning to end this experience was terrible. The prescriber I was matched with was extremely rude and dismissive. She was visibly rolling her eyes and sighing at me when she got annoyed with my responses to her questions. When my chosen pharmacy ran out of my meds I messaged my care team for 2 weeks in the chat and received little to no response. I emailed, I called numbers and no one would/could help me get my script changed to a different pharmacy or change dosages. When I finally got someone to respond to me after literally begging someone to answer me in the chat they lied and told me my pharmacist said they were out of the smaller dosage (I had been communicating w/ my pharmacist almost daily & she said that never happened & was holding the meds for me all I needed was the ok from the prescriber). 
I felt helpless, I literally cried I was so frustrated. I can only say thank gd my diagnosed issue wasn’t depression because I was without meds for 2 weeks because my “care team” was ignoring me. 
Save yourself some stress and go elsewhere for help.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Kudos to this company for trying to provide much needed assistance in the mental health space. I think this start up has potential, but I experienced too many inconsistencies and issues for me to justify staying with Cerebral. Unfortunately I’d rather make the 45 minute drive to my primary care; something I was hoping to eliminate after subscribing to Cerebral. For example, it took 7-10 days to get a response from my prescriber via my Care Coordinator. In my opinion, response time to a medication question should never be 7-10 days. In addition, getting an appointment with a prescriber can take weeks so if for some reason you have to cancel and reschedule, expect to wait weeks for your next appointment. Don’t expect to have direct contact with your prescriber should you have a question or concern. You will have to go through a Care Coordinator, and from my experience it seems as though the Care Coordinators are unable to handle the volume of members/subscribers.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"My first prescriber put me on some meds and I had questions after I started them and wrote in for help to never hear back on two separate issues. Switched prescribers, broke out from a Wellbutrin rash that turned into a severe allergic reaction causing hives all over my body and my lips and eyes swole. Wrote in for advice, never heard back. Had to go to the ER. Wrote in for help again. No one could get ahold of my prescriber. I was instructed by the ER to stop taking the meds. Now 2 days without any meds for my mental health issues and the prescriber has yet to been reached. I don’t know why they can’t forward me to a new prescriber? It’s an absolute joke. Seems to me that it’s professionals using this as easy money on the side because there is no urgency. I do not feel like a priority and for a service that is supposed to be a resource for people with mental health issues this should have a better system in place. Absolutely appalled at how much they neglected me in less than 2 months of this service. Unacceptable.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I am actually going into professional forensic counseling so I know what I want when I’m looking for a counselor/ psychiatrist. The amount of times I was unable to get my medication or join a meeting based on the COMPANIES mistake is unbelievable. This is usually followed with some gaslighting and no apology. For example: my psychiatrist wrote my prescription wrong.. this prescription is very important to take daily for the side affects are less than pleasant. When I desperately tried to contact anyone at cerebral to fix this.. it took them SEVERAL DAYS. They did not apologize instead they told me it was my fault for not reaching out earlier. As if I was supposed to know my script would be messed up. This is just one of many many mistakes. I do not recommend this service to anyone. Seems like they just want the money. The care is pretty crappy too. You get to see a counselor MAYBE once a month because they usually have NO availability. Not worth what you’re paying for. I left with more anxiety then I came in with.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Cerebral is decently affordable and when I signed up, was able to schedule an appointment with the prescriber the next day. The appointment went well, and I was prescribed my medications and was assured they were being delivered as soon as possible. 

Two days later, I had not been billed for the medication, never received a tracking number, email confirmation, etc. So I reached out to my care coordinator and they contacted me the following day. They assured me they would reach out to whomever needed to be talked to and would relay info to me as soon as they received it. 
Days passed and I heard nothing, so two days ago I reached out again to the coordinator and they have not responded. 

It has been over a week since I saw my prescriber and have received nothing for it. I reach out and am essentially told to wait. I have now gone without my medication because of this.

I have asked to cancel my subscription and have been informed it will take 1-2 days before they reach out to me to actually cancel. I can’t help but not have any faith that they will actually contact me.

I am also trying to receive a refund since I have not received any services, but once again I am told to wait for someone to get back to me. Something which I have little hope for.

I see the potential in cerebrals model, but it really feels as if they took my money and ran. They did just enough to get me to put in my card information and then fulfilled none of their promises.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I joined cerebral in hopes to get back on track with my adhd meds. The supposed place to go for your adhd needs.

I’m sick of these people with the power to write scripts telling me take this , or this , or this , and this . Quit allowing people to destroy your lives with a bunch of antipsychotic meds when you know yourself well enough to know what works . I am not bipolar, I am adhd. I was a test dummy for these clinical idiots for over ten years of my life . Misdiagnosed and still to this day these idiots want to try to say I don’t recognize my own self and the behaviors of adhd. Which are constantly mistaken in several woman by the way .

I was given medication I told my provider I had taken before and of course, it didn’t help me but I tried it anyways with no results of course and yes, I gave it the minimum time to look for results before I started TRYING to cancel my subscription. They offered me a discount since I was still seeing no results, so I gave it some more time until I was really ready to be done with the app and try moving on the an actual Mental Health doctor in a physical office I could go to. I canceled and filled out the cancellation paperwork and continued to get billed repeatedly. They ended up taking well over 100$ from me and didn’t offer any type of resolution, a refund of any form or even an apology.

Then, when my first therapy appointment came, I got stood up.  Therapist never showed.  I emailed support TWICE.  No response.  3 days later I get a barrage of auto-generated emails telling me that I missed my appointment, even tho I was on waiting.  Then they rescheduled me, without my knowledge, and sent me appointments that i did not choose with DIFFERENT providers during my work hours.  It says to click to reschedule, so I did.  Neither of the providers had even one available appointment going all the way into 2022.  I got ripped off during one of the most emotional and vulnerable points in my life.

At the start of the year, I entered my new insurance information, and without explanation of the changes, my plan was changed to medication management (I don’t currently take medication), cutting off my connection to my therapist and canceling my upcoming appointment. I was unable to reach customer service for assistance. As you may be able to imagine, I was extremely anxious. I changed my plan back to the previous plan hoping to re-connect to my therapist and was charged for another month of service and offered different therapists. When I finally reached customer service the next day, they offered a 30% refund on the erroneous billing.

1,"This service is a scam and an easy way to spend several hundred dollars and end up feeling worse off than you started. My counselor didn't show up to appointments for two weeks then I was informed that she left Cerebral and my new counselor was a random man. When I signed up, I chose to have a counselor that was a woman of color - only when I paid did I find out only white women were available, so I settled. So to be assigned a random man to speak to about DV and SA felt horrible, and so abrupt with no closure with my previous counselor who I had slowly been opening up to after months. Cerebral customer service will not refund me for the month when I had no counselor, no communication, and 4 appointments where my counselor or provider didn't show up. They send template responses citing their policy as a way of deflecting and not addressing the harm they've caused. I don't understand how they can treat people seeking help with depression and anxiety in such an uncaring way. It's dehumanizing. You're really just an ATM to them.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

This appears the one that could get me in the soonest, I paid $30 for my first month, was unable to meet with my first prescribed because I was matched to someone not in my state. I had to reschedule for 2 weeks out. I was then locked out of my account that same day. I reached out to support that gave me some troubleshooting tips which none worked. I was then more stressed out and could not wait any longer and trying to fix the issues was even more stress I didn’t need. I then have tried to cancel my subscription and get a refund for weeks now. I was just informed I am getting refunded $9.00. I literally just handed them money to do absolutely nothing since I have been locked out of the account and I am unable to use their “subscription”.

I had one of the worst weeks that I’ve ever lived through while using this app and I desperately needed help. Less than 24 hours before my appointment it gets cancelled due to a family emergency. It was something I excused, but I waited awhile for a reply on the date and nothing. The week got worse and I didn’t get a callback or anything. I had a meltdown and called to cancel my account, before I noticed that they charged me. Mind you: we were still starting, so NO REAL THERAPY HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE. After an extremely heated voicemail I demanded reimbursement because I didn’t get any service.

I was told they would oblige and it would be honored however due to their billing policy I would get NOTHING. The one ray of hope I had peeled away because of bureaucratic policies. I hate this app and will never forgive the people who run this company nor the company.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

Just before my third appointment I realized I had been locked out of my account although I had been billed. They refunded me, said it was a billing issue they were working to resolve. I was billed again and still did not have access to my account. I reached out and got a second refund and decided to cancel my subscription. I filled out the cancellation form and received confirmation of my cancellation and was billed again the next month. I reached out and once again had to get a refund, but my account was overdrafted because I was jot expecting to be billed for a service that I had cancelled.

1,"I created an account on Cerebral website about 3 hours ago. During the onboarding, they asked for my credit card info before they acquire my insurance info, and immediately, unwittingly charged me.

Only after taking my card info and personal data did they notify me that my insurance wasn’t accepted,so I decided to quit the onboarding session, checked my phone, and found out they charged me $99.

I tried to call them, emailed them, what I was told: they can’t issue me the refund. 

I kept saying that I had no idea you don’t take my insurance, and you didn’t make it clear at all that you would charge me before even I find a therapist. 

I didn’t make any appointment, didn’t receive any service from them, and yet I’m out 100 bucks.

Besides this sleight of hand during the onboarding, what really upset me was they do not care about you. Their customer service kept saying a bunch of irrelevant things and trying not to take any responsibility for this situation. 

Be careful if you need help and you want to try Cerebral, you may will end up like me, spend $99 to have someone tell you that it’s your problem that your insurance is not on our list and we cannot issue the refund because we did absolutely nothing for you and this is the cost for giving us all your information without receiving any service.

I signed up during a time of incredible stress and was repeatedly assigned to providers in the wrong state or who did not have my availability, despite speaking with NUMEROUS coordinators about the problem over the course of a full month. We messages back and forth on the app, through multiple support emails, and phone calls to customer service. I paid for five sessions and received zero despite spending more time than the sessions would have taken trying to correct the errors they made. When I communicated this for the last time I was told that what I paid was for the membership, not the services (which is absurd for a membership you HAVE TO MAKE WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING SERVICES) so I was not eligible to be refunded for what I spent.

This seemed like a great way to eliminate that need all together, so I downloaded and paid for my prescription. 

I spoke with someone about pricing and was advised of the monthly cost, which I was given the impression INCLUDED the cost of medication. I was advised it did not, and began to fear I wouldn’t be able to keep up with the expedited pricing but assessed I would keep it until I could no longer afford it. 

I had my first visit with the NP and she advised the cost of my medication was $29 (this was when I found out the cost of medication was not included in the price) and that it would continue at $29 for the next three months. (She only advised for $90 days and actually looked the information up).

Upon paying for my first prescription month, I received an email advising the refill price was $69. I immediately reached out to support as I had been advised otherwise. Support informed me that indeed the price “had gone up” and then tried to talk me into keeping it as that was “less than most copays” I don’t know what copays y’all dealing with. But the most I’ve ever had as a copay was $20 and my medication was never more than $20 

I advise you to save you money and look into insurance as most states that I’m aware of, offer free mental healthcare and medications.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Hello, the only reason I’m rating it 1/5 is because cerebral doesn’t accept my insurance, and it felt like it was more of a money grab thing then actual help. I shouldn’t have to give 200$ a month for a doctor to tell me, “we need to wait a month+ then talk to your primary care doctor before we can even actually discuss meds that will work.” If I come to you for help and I pay you for said help, I shouldn’t be told hey we need to wait 3 months at a rate of 200+ before I can actually give you the medication meant for someone with ADHD, after you’ve already been diagnosed with ADHD. I was put on the same medication my primary doctor gave me, then told I had to wait a month+ before we could discuss anything else even when the medication wasn’t working. Plus, I don’t think I should pay for a service where you can’t have a meeting with a doctor in a month’s time, you are booked from October to December basically all the way through, so no doctors to prescribe or even listen to your words.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This is basically an $85/mo subscription to having a 5 minute prescription appointment every two months. These are not psychiatrists, but nurse practitioners. 

I cancelled a few days ago, and expected to be able to enjoy the rest of my subscription. I have a week left on my subscription at the time of writing this review. They apparently contacted my pharmacy this morning and changed my refill from costing its usual $15 to $130, despite the subscription supposedly still being active (never had insurance so no change there). They also removed my eligibility for future refills I was previously approved for. Luckily, my pharmacy was appalled and was able to discount it heavily this once. 

While I’m sure at least the refill part may be under some sort of policy, it seems very spiteful that they update the script into being nearly 9x the price the minute you cancel, making it effectively cheaper to trap you into keeping the service. 

Additionally, rather than being able to schedule your own appointments, you need to essentially ask permission from a third party or “care coordinator”, making it easy to delay or forget about scheduling. The “counseling” aspect is a joke. 

You are better off scheduling a telehealth visit every 3 months for your refills. If it’s cheaper than $250 a visit, you’re saving money. Or better yet, a real psychiatrist may even be cheaper. 

Not cool, cerebral.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The NP I scheduled time with to prescribe medication was wonderful. However, it was difficult to find a therapist to fit what I needed, on a schedule that worked for me. Once I did find a match, the therapist was 15 minutes late to our appointment without an apology. She did not wear headphones, which created an echo during our session. As a person with sensory issues, this was an issue for me and I did not want to pay for a service that was not helpful. The therapist was not kind and showed no desire to be helpful in any way. I reached out to cerebral to share my frustration and I’ve not heard a response. I cancelled my service nearly immediately because the overall experience was frustrating and unprofessional. When canceling, you lose all access to the portal. So even though I paid for the month, I was then unable to secure access to any other sessions for that month. I reached out for help and a refund, without any response. I do not recommend this service or this company.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The first appointment I had such high hopes. I was very disappointed after. I was told prescriptions were $10. I was charged $20 for both. Which still isn’t terrible but not what I was told. Then when it came to get my refill. The medication I canceled a week prior was still filled and I was charged for. The mg for my second prescription was incorrect. When I tried to reach out no one answered my messages. When I called and actually got a team member, she got silent when she realized I was right. She couldn’t get off the phone fast enough. This was around 3:00pm. I then called back the next day around 1:00pm because still no one had reached out to me. This was completely unprofessional and I am currently trying to cancel and get my money back for the prescription that should have never been filled. Truly sad that people who are genuinely seeking help have to deal with issues such as these. I was looking for help, for assistance and support. I got none of that and wasted my money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The weight loss division of this company is very new - staff turns over a lot and the company is disorganized. The customer service rep i spoke to said she is only allowed to point someone back to the app to post a question there, they don’t help anyone by phone with technical issues, billing issues, etc. The newest app version doesn’t work on an iPad. The app has MANY issues that the tech people can’t seem to fix. They emailed me to ask for help in reporting if problems continued. I don’t get paid to help them! Figure it out yourself. The lower paid staff is forced to deal with all issues and keep customers away from anyone of power, yet given no ability to fix anything - and it is all done by chat that takes 24-72 hours to return any message. They often procrastinate by dodging questions or complaints. The nurse practitioner and dieticians I’ve had are amazing. This company has MANY areas to improve upon if this is going to work long term.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This is the first review I have ever left in 15 years of iPhone ownership. The application itself is excellent. The service, however, is not. I have had three unspecific cancellations and had to reschedule several weeks from the original appointment dates. And now, due to policy changes, prescribers are no longer able to prescribe effective medications. While I understand this change likely had to due with Federal law, this has been a completely unacceptable way of handling clients who have been with Cerebral prior to this change. I have had not one, but three cancellations that would have landed me far before the May 9th date of this policy change. It is unfair treatment and frankly unprofessional the way this was handled from the very beginning with the first cancellation that left me questioning Cerebral’s reliability. I was first left in the dark as to why the appointments were manually being overridden and cancelled and here today I am now suffering from this negligence. Stay away.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"How in the world does this app have this many high reviews? This apps functionality is TERRIBLE. 

 Not only did I just get an email that my next medication has been ordered after only 2 weeks, (which, I told my care counselor that I wanted to talk to my prescriber), I can't even book a call with my prescriber. My next billing date isn’t even for another 1.5 weeks!!! And besides I should be checking in with my prescriber beforehand. There’s 0 follow up here, it’s only you yourself that has to book everything and even then, there’s no links to schedule! The app is completely useless to schedule anything and the person that messaged me told me to use your website instead which also doesn't work either. 

On top of that, there is no information regarding how or when I will get information about my insurance reimbursement. Your website states I'll get a check in the mail or something but somehow I highly doubt this will happen. Your system is absolutely broken. I also have no way to contact my prescriber, who is also not even part of the messaging system. 

Also why is there no option to cancel within the portal? You make it hard to not only schedule calls but also don't make anything else easy.

Don’t sign up for this. They do not care about you and as lovely as my counselor was, it’s clear she’s just following a script.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This is just a ridiculous scam to charge your credit card every chance they get. I’ve had the provider not show to 2 appointments and they charged me for No Show $29 reschedule fee each time. WHAT?? I was there! I recorded it on my phone! I have actually time-stamped proof that I was waiting. Then I emailed support and got back several ridiculous roboresponses. “Sorry you missed your appointment” I DIDN’T!  I said I would like to change my provider. “We’re sorry you are cancelling your service”. WHAT? I said I wanted to YOU TO CHANGE THE PROVIDER. 
Then my providers are like in a strange dark closet or I’m looking at the top of their heads like I’m FaceTiming my grandpa. And to put the icing on this cake- my card was JUST charged for “services from 2021”! 3 different charges! HUH??? UM- SCAM MUCH?? That was it for me! Maybe they need to understand that they are dealing with people that have mental illnesses and actually consider how difficult seeking help actually is for us and maybe care like they claim. Such a disappointment.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was assigned a prescriber who I haven’t been able to book an appointment with for 6 months, all of course while they continued to charge me monthly, so I’ve paid for 6 months of service I haven’t received, and on top of that the customer service I’ve received in regards to this has been horrific, they’ve taken zero responsibility and operate without any ethics or accountability. Top of that off, when I needed sign off to begin another treatment because of the lack of treatment from Cerebral, my provider (who I’ve never spoken to because he doesn’t have ANY availability, confirmed by my care coordinator who checked and then did not attempt to provide me with a new prescriber) refuses to sign off on the new treatment, so my care is basically being held hostage by a prescriber I’ve never met, and who knows essentially nothing about me, and he refuses to provide a reason for not signing off on the new treatment. On paper this is a fantastic service, in practice, it’s horrific.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The psychiatrist that I met with was rude and short with me and made me cry both times I had an appointment with her. She dismissed all of my concerns, diagnosed me as ADHD and then acted like there was something wrong with me when I didn’t wanna take the same medication that I had been given before that did not work for me. She made it seem like I should be grateful that she had even prescribed strattera which gave me hives and I had an allergic reaction to. She then wanted to diagnose something else in the same family of medicines. All the while I’m paying out of pocket for these trial and error medication and they are unable to prescribe anything else aside from Strattera and Wellbutrin. The ads on Facebook made it sound like you could in fact get other medication if you were diagnosed as having ADHD and that in fact they could even come to your door. This could not be further from the truth. Do not waste your time or money and now I’m having a difficult time canceling the subscription.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Make sure you’ve reviewed all plans prior to purchasing. Otherwise any promotional pricing is invalid. In my first intake appointment my care provider told me to switch my account, and the plan change is considered an “upgrade” and is no longer available to receive the promotional pricing… even though I just purchased the app plan only days prior and didn’t receive any counseling. It is truly a corporate disservice to any first time user in the cerebral app. If the first selected plan is not fitting for the patient, you will then be charged two and a half times the advertised rate on top of being charged for the first month. All while having received no mental health aide, as requested i.e. I paid $30 “for one month” and after one day I am told that in order to receive any service I now have to pay an additional $259. Great app concept. Flawed and dishonest payment system.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

I first called about canceling my service and was told they do not do that over the phone. So I sent an email, they replied with an automated message that said I needed to fill out a cancellation form. I have now sent multiple emails and filled out multiple forms but cerebral will not stop attempting to take another $325 from my card. My card has been locked for weeks and it’s causing a great inconvenience for me as I have other things on automatic payment and the due dates are approaching. I called my credit card company and they are unable to block the charges.

1,"I was with this company for over a year and had nothing but constant issues. 

I was assigned a new provider and I spoke with her twice telling her that my current medication was working well and I didn’t want to adjust it. 2 months later she decided to drastically drop the dosage of my medication without speaking with some or even notifying me!! The only reason I sound out is because I running low on the meds and looked at the bottle to see it was a drastically different prescription. 2 weeks of trying to get the issue resolved I get told that she did that on purpose and wanted to speak with me. Ummm no! I will not speak with someone who is rude, unprofessional and negligent at best. And they told me “ sorry for any miscommunication we can set you up with a different provider” That’s a no. My issues was downplayed and not resolved. I will find a company that think “ I’m sorry” is an appropriate resolution to a major issue and who actually cares. 

Screw this man. Not worth it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up for the talk therapy package which was $99 a month. The app kept having bugs where it would not except my insurance card or my ID or my facial recognition. Blue Cross Blue Shield was listed in the insurance accepted but after I purchased my plan they told me to scan in my insurance card, however the scanner didn’t work so I emailed it to them and then they told me they don’t accept it. Because I couldn’t get the app to work properly and because all of a sudden they didn’t take my insurance I went to cancel. They quickly told me they will not refund my money even though I did not use any services. The app pretends you can select the type of counselor you want but they only gave me one choice no matter what options I chose. They overpromise and under deliver and have their contracts wired tight to keep your money. The irony is this is an app that supposed to make you less stressed but it added to my stress.

You’re paying $85 a month for someone to give you medicine which the monthly payment does not include your medicine nor do they warn you how much your medicine is before they take it out of your account. Lastly it took them almost a whole month to simply cancel my subscription & delete my account & I was assured that I would not be charged again, they FINALLY cancelled my account & then charged me 2 days after for the full $85, after I reached out to them to express how I was told I wouldn’t be charged and needed a refund they said it would take 1-2 business days until I got that refund & its 5 business days later & I still haven’t received that refund, not worth it to even try.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up because their website said they accepted my insurance. Except they don’t allow users to check insurance before charging them. After I paid then I am informed that they don’t take my insurance. But I decided to give it a try anyway. So I set my appointment. I found someone to watch my kids, rearranged my schedule, and logged in 5 min early as instructed. I waited until 12 min after my appointment time before finally leaving the call because the clinician never logged in. 

I tried to contact support and I received a form email of “I'm sorry to hear that you've decided to discontinue receiving mental health services from Cerebral.” I can’t discontinue a service that was never provided in the first place. All in all it has been a poor experience and I just would like my money back so that I can find a provider that will help me. But I’m sure I will have to fight to get my money back.

1,"I am very dissatisfied with the level of care I have received from Cerebral. I came to Cerebral because I need help with my ADHD that is severally impacting my life and I have not been able to receive my medication because I cannot get the doctor to move my prescription to another pharmacy. This should be an easy fix, yet time and time again I cannot get in touch with the provider to make this change. It has been months now and it is extremely frustrating and debilitating when taking the first step just to make this appointment was extremely difficult for me. If Cerebral is unable to provide a decent level of care they should not be working in the mental health care space.  I am requesting immediate assistance or at the very least a refund for the months I have been paying without receiving help.

1,"I’ve been stuck behind ID verification for months and cannot access the portal to cancel. Cerebral has continued to charge me. When reaching out to customer support, they offer me a discount for future services, and say they can give me $100 in refund (out of $420+) “as an exception”. They claim because they’re a subscription service, I had access and therefore cannot get a refund. They claim “mental healthcare tends to go at a different pace for everyone as some clients use our services daily while others choose to use them more sparingly”. I never had access to any services, and I definitely had no “choice” to use it sparingly. 

I’ve tried multiple venues of customer service to no avail. They are making me work very hard and this is definitely not fit for someone with ADHD, and is preying off of “clients”.

1,I really loved this program. But the moment I switched to a different provider that was covered by my insurance I stopped my service. When I needed to tell my new doctor the medication that I was prescribed by the provider on here all my information is gone. I am being asked questions like how many milligrams exct.. I was taking and I could not give an answer! Mind you I was prescribed meds that can not just be stopped or I will experience severe withdrawal symptoms! I couldn’t even find the providers name anymore! I looked completely delusional!  I reached out to customer service and have not heard anything back I am absolutely disgusted not only for the unprofessional actions but for the facts they made me look an absolute fool! I promise this is the review that should really make you think is the price for this horrible service worth it? Do they care about your well-being or your money? You can find better and more effective services else where!!!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"TLDR: they make cancelling impossible and won’t answer the phone and then won’t give a full refund. Call your bank and block them as soon as you cancel. 

I tried this app out mostly because they did a great job marketing and my ADHD doesn’t do well with focusing enough to find someone on my own. The monthly subscription doesn’t actually cover anything but their service of connecting to someone which ended up being more than I was willing to pay in the long run. Cancelling is next to impossible though. I went through the process but it took them months to stop pulling money from my account. I finally had to call my bank and block their withdrawal. When I called to get the months back that I had cancelled, they tried to give me a 30% refund instead of a full refund. Honestly the app isn’t a bad idea overall but the company is scummy, especially considering their trying to “help” the mental health community.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This app is great if you are struggling and need medication quick. The providers and care professionals are great at listening. The customer service through the app is absolutely horrible. You can only communicate through messaging there is no number to call. The person responsible for responding to messages only responds once a day so it’s difficult to get help if there is an issue with medication or your plan. Im happy I downloaded it to get me on medication I desperately needed, but i will be canceling and going to an actual doctor because this app is HORRIBLE. UPDATED : To say YOU CANNOT CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. Every single time you click “change membership plan” it says “an unforseen error has occurred “ i have been trying to change my plan for months. There is no “ unforseen error” THATS JUST WHAT CEREBRAL WANTS YOU TO THINK. The only way you can change your plan is by messaging them and getting the round about why you shouldnt.

1,"Cerebral was too good to be true when it came around and it took me a while to realize how it was another money making scam. The physicians cancel appts at the last minute , without offering any new appt dates in sight. The whole health model is planned and executed so poorly, a lot is left to be desired. You ll be left stranded for a month or two with no medication refills . Also there is no physician patient relationship , the care team is very helpless in conveying problems to physician and coming up with solutions . You ll be paying out of your pocket month after month for no services at all. And if you cancel , they immediately stop all access but will still find reasons to charge for the upcoming month without letting you use any service. Most of the physicians I have seen have left cerebral , and it is evident that this whole image they have created is flawed on so many levels . It’s a big money making scam.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I really wanted to love Cerebral. I got a feeling when it wouldn’t tell me if insurance covered the service until I paid, but continued on. Met with a prescriber who confirmed all of my symptoms. Didn’t really give and danced around a diagnosis. I was prescribed psychiatric meds and told to give it a month. That’s fine. Then I met with a care counselor. Both of them assured me the other could fill out some paperwork needed for my job to allow me to stay working from home. I sent the forms over and almost a week later got the response that the prescriber doesn’t have the necessary “expertise” to fill out said paperwork and I should seek in person treatment. If they don’t have enough expertise to sign a form confirming what I filled out, do they have the expertise to prescribe drugs that could cause me to become suicidal? I’m not sure. I have taken my care coordinators suggestion and switch my appointments to in person treatment with an actual psychologist.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Overall very disappointed with this service . I was really upset that no one bothered to tell me I would be charged for the medication they sent, I thought it was included in plan until I noticed a random charge from this app. I felt like the medication appointment was strange and my counselor had no idea what I was taking when I met with her. I was more asked what do I want instead of determined what I need. 

When I got to my first appointment with the counselor she called me instead of doing a video call. This was incredibly uncomfortable and I felt I in no way could find connection like this with the counselor. The meeting in general felt stale and scripted like she was reading off one question after the other. 

Come to cancelling.. what a PROCESS 
You have to email them for one guy to email you to send a link to a form asking why you’re cancelling in different ways, then you email him back to wait for someone else to get back to you and try to convince you not to cancel for a discount ( instead of offering discounts automatically maybe you should determine why people are cancelling so much that you have to offer them!), 
I am still waiting for that response, what a stressful process.

Don’t get me wrong, the nurse and counselor were both very nice but the structure makes you feel like a number and not like they truly care about your mental health.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"My experience with cerebral has only been infuriating. The provider I had rescheduled my initial appointment twice, without notification. Then she called me an hour before my scheduled appointment wanting to see me then. I was at work and couldn’t just drop everything in that moment. Absolutely no consideration for my time. So time for my appointment, I click on the link for our video appointment. She doesn’t answer. Instead she calls me again. Whatever. Her kids are SCREAMING in the background. She talks over me, very condescendingly, and doesn’t listen to a word I say until I yell at her to shut up and listen to me. Then to top things off her fire alarm goes off. Who knows why. So I end up finding a provider in my area. I cancelled my subscription last month only to find they have charged me again yesterday. When I contact support, they send me the form to cancel again.

Then, after almost a month, I attempted to contact them again because I needed a refill. I was told that because I had failed to enter in payment information that I could not receive a refill and that I needed to update it. Unfortunately, there is no where for a person to enter payment information on either the site or the app. And now I’m 3 days overdue for a refill and no one has helped at all. All I get is responses back saying that the issue is “being worked on” but there’s clearly zero accountability or concern about the Wheatley and we’ll being of patients placed on SSRIs and then suddenly being forced to stop due to this company’s complete lack of adherence understanding OR any real customer assistance.

1,"I don’t trust this company at all. They offered a special for the first month in their own website for $7/week for the first month. When you go to check out, they charge you $30. When I called and questioned the fact that $7 * 4 weeks in a month is $28, they first replied that they were aware of the error and “reached out” to have it fixed as though it was another company’s website that had an error. In addition, after not signing up, I have gotten over a dozen emails and texts within 2 days still offering the same $7/week. At one point while contacting them, they tried to explain it away by saying that some months have more than 4 weeks. Honestly, if they can’t do simple math and quickly fix pricing errors on their own website and various other communications and make up fake reasons to justify their errors, I would not trust them to not overbill your criedit/debit card or your insurance.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Therapy only plan: therapist was good. The app and ‘exercises’ in the app are very inadequate for actual self-help. There are books out there that do a much better job. Talk to therapist in real time 45 minutes once a week. Care coordinator the rest of the time. Must give 24 hours to respond so no real-time help. If you say negative about them on Facebook, they will block you even if honest review. My experience would be to find a better, more in-depth service to help with therapy needs. 

App has about three sections total: care-coordinator chat, plan information (scheduling therapy and stuff) and exercises. They text you and call a lot telling you to make an appointment even if you have a standing one. Their program cancelled my appointment once and was told it was an insurance issue-I was self paying so not sure what was going on with that.

1,"This is my second try with Cerebral and it was just as disappointing as the first. Upon reactivating my account and providing my payment information it would not let me proceed with any scheduling, said to contact support. 
After contacting support they gave generic tips, the only one that worked was opening the webpage in incognito mode browser on a PC, the app was not functional. I was able to schedule 1 of 2 appointments but it still gave me an error scheduling a care counselor. 
I reached out to support again and they assigned me a counselor of their choosing and booked me a 7am weekday appointment. I reached back out and requested that I be able to choose my own provider and appointment time but they advised that was not an option.

This went on for an additional 3 months. Once I finally had enough and I sent an email requesting my account be canceled, it took days to get a response and they make you jump through hoops to cancel. Once I finally received a response I was told I still owed $85 for my last month’s service and was told if I did not pay they would send me to collections.

I requested a new provider to which they scheduled another appointment that i didnt even confirm. 4 months into this, i tried to ask for at least a 2 month refund, since that is when the service that i was paying for actually stopped being given to me, and they allowed me to cancel but didnt even refund me. So i paid for 2 months without anything to show for it. Terrible medical help, i would not recommend this app!

1,"I started cerebral a few months ago after a traumatic event. At first, it seemed simple enough and I felt like I was getting a lot of care. As months went on, I’ve had to deal with several app and server issues. I was locked out of my account, all my prescriber + counseling appointments were wiped from the schedule, my prescription was never sent, my care coordinator has been MIA for weeks, etc. It sounds like they’re still working on backend issues both technologically and operationally. It’s too much to deal with unstable mental health care, when I am TRYING to get stable. I called Cerebral for a 1-month refund when I was locked out of my account for a month and didn’t receive services; I had to fight to get a refund for care I never received! I’ve never missed a payment and all of my info is up to date. My iOS + app are also all up to date, so this was all entirely on Cerebral. Not a fan, no longer a patient.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was very interested in this service as I am very busy but struggle with anxiety and depression. They charged $99 for the first month(which I thought was good for an app)... I had one 45 minute conversation after 2 weeks with zero goals set or anything. I scheduled another appointment and in the mean time was charged another $197. I informed them that I thought the service was $99 and I was no longer interested, they cancelled my membership but refused to issue a refund and cancelled all my scheduled appointments but informed me I could still use their platform. Why would you charge me $197, cancel my appointments but then tell me I can use the app for the rest of the month? Doesn't make sense and for being concerned about mental health they certainly have no issues charging money  for doing literally NOTHING, and then subsequently refusing refunds (within 24 hours of charge). This app is lame and their customer service is poor at best.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Please, please save yourself, your time, and your mental health and use Circle Medical or something. I can guarantee that most positive reviews of this website is fake. 

They charge an exorbinant fee (hundreds of dollars EVERY MONTH),and most likely don't accept your insurance (but won't tell you that until you've entered the contract). Oh, you say, but if I just do medication management, that's only $80 a month? You will never see that medication, my friend. ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, whatever. You will never see it, or it'll take two months to process through your insurance (oh, it usually takes two weeks! They say, although most providers commonly only take 48 hours). 

The care team is unhelpful and condescending, customer support is the same, and the doctors are nice but you won't be able to get an appointment more than once or twice every few months. This website just wants your money. Run. There is no sticking it out.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was advised by a counselor with Cerebral to look into speaking with a therapist through their services. when I did as was recommended I saw a list of the different plans they offered with no prices listed and end up getting charged $175 without ever confirming a purchase when I was just trying to look up the information. I overdrafted in my bank account which now as a result of that has added an additional $72 in fees, won’t have the money for gas to get to work, and currently have no food whatsoever. That money was for groceries. I’m trying to fight the fraudulent charges through my bank but won’t have any money for 6 days at the earliest. Because of Cerebral I now won’t be able to eat for 6-8 days!!! I won’t be able to get to work for a week and probably will lose my job! All because I was trying to get help with mental health. Thanks Cerebral, you guys have really helped me a lot!!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This experience with cerebral only elevated my anxiety. First off, my care provider prescribed the incorrect dose of my prescription. After my first month, I received an email that my prescription was no longer available for home delivery. Fine. But then I could not get in touch with my care provider for weeks after this notification to move my prescription to a pharmacy. When I finally got in touch with my care team, they cryptically assigned another provider and offered a “small discount” for the invoice. Ok. But then my new provider informed me that she could not prescribe me the correct dose despite the original provider having the correct dose in her notes, and on top of that she informed me that the pharmacy I chose might not be able to fill my prescription without offering alternatives. Long story short I received one month of care despite paying for 4 months of this service and I am infuriated.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This program is spammy. You are not made aware what comes with the package you are buying until after you have been charged. When you agree to their terms and conditions you are apparently also agreeing to zero refunds but they may be willing to give you a whopping $7.50 back instead of the $25 they charge you and that’s if you cancel within hours of being signed up! The only way I could get logged in to be found to cancel was to finish setting up the account. Once you are cancelled, they immediately cancel all appointments you have, that by the way, have basically no availability for a month, out meaning you get absolutely nothing for the “service” but more headache that the process is worth. To be clear, I reached out to them and expressed this to them before I wrote this review. Thanks for making seeking mental health more stressful Cerebral!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Paid for a therapy plan then got switched to a different plan when I added my insurance. It wasn’t clear that my plan would be changed by just adding my insurance. After that, they canceled my therapy session and booked me a prescriber that didn’t really do anything other than ask me the same questions in the original questionnaire. I asked to cancel altogether because the app is clunky and difficult to book anything. Because I took the call with the prescriber who was supposed to connect me with a counselor but never did, I was still charged for the month. I tried to cancel altogether and they said since I took that initial call, I wouldn’t be refunded but they deactivated my account. So I was charged for a month even though I got literally nothing out of it and can’t even get into the system to at least use for the month I already paid for.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This app was a horrible experience for me. I am at a real breaking point with my mental health and needed to get on medication. First of all the app is super glitchy and does not work half the time, I have no problems with any other app on my phone. Secondly they are horrible at communication. I set up my first prescriber appointment and they did not show up. I finally got an appointment where they actually showed up on the video call and I was told that she basically wasn’t qualified to prescribe the medication I needed and that she would set me up an appointment with a new prescriber who could. She said it would be within  48 hrs and I went a week without hearing anything. Still haven’t heard anything. I keep messaging my care counselor and don’t hear anything back. I ended up cancelling my subscription today and thankfully I only spent 30 dollars since I never was really able to get the process started.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I had one meeting where they told me their care works best when you’re medicated. I don’t prefer that. They wouldn’t sign a paper for my school indicating I have ADD but they wanted to prescribe me. Once I said no, she told me she didn’t feel comfortable signing the paper…. Odd. You don’t want to indicate I have ADD but you’ll give me meds for it? Seemed like she didn’t want me to get what I came for and was scared I’d want to cancel afterwards. Instead, I tried to cancel because they had unethical practices and then after I emailed their cancellation email, TWICE they still charged me $83 the next month. I paid $30 + $83 for ONE session. And nope, NO REFUNDS DESPITE IF YOU USE THE SERVICES OR NOT. Still dealing with cancellation. I am a college student who’s suffering financially. I chose cerebral because they were “affordable” but now it’s just a nightmare I keep having to deal with. 
All I wanted was a refund after that experience.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Cerebral honestly sucked after my provider was removed. It hurt me more than it helped. I came to the app when it was new, with the help of my mom. There weren’t many ways to contact anyone for help and my provider was switched without my knowledge. When I sent an email for help, I got little to none and I couldn’t switch my provider back to who I felt comfortable with. In my email, I stated I wouldn’t be using the app and wanted to cancel. My mom has been paying $86 for about a year and was told we didn’t try to cancel prior to to receive payment for the months I did not use this app. Although I did and have the email to prove it, I’ve decided to leave this review to help those who may be skeptical on using the app. I say, if you like surprises on your account/plan, or surprises taken out your account after asking for cancelation then absolutely.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They are predatory. They make it extremely difficult to cancel your account. They need to “approve” your cancellation. Until some random staff member approves it (which could take forever), they will continue to charge you. If this happens to you, make a complaint with the BBB and contact your attorney generals office. Take screenshots of all communications with this company so you can dispute the charges with your credit card company if they continue to charge you. So far, I’ve been told they have “received my cancellation form” but it must be reviewed. Until that happens, my account is active. They do this purposely to try to scam as many people out of every last dollar that they can. There are dozens and dozens of horrible reviews about this company’s awful tactics. Numerous news outlets have already run stories about their deceptive practices as well. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT SIGN UP. Save yourself the headache.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,The idea behind this is brilliant.  I was very optimistic and anxious to try this.  After my first appointment with a subscriber they told me I would need to go to someone else.  So I basically wasted 30 minutes with this person.  They told me they would send a link to make an appointment ASAP with my new person.  They never sent the link.  So I had to reach out and of course no responses in my app messages.  I finally got a hold of someone and they emailed me a link to pick a date.  He’s booked through November!  Yet they charge monthly!  This means I’m paying monthly but don’t even get to talk to anyone for 2 months.  This is unacceptable.  I have sent an email to cancel and I’m sure that will take days to get a response.  Very disappointing.  Buyers be aware. It’s obvious they were doing things right before and they outsourced which is what good companies always do to save money once they gain a great reputation and clientele.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I decided to try this app because therapy is expensive and this seemed like a good option to try. All is good at first unless you want to make any changes at all. My therapist option isn’t a good fit for me because I’m a female and was hoping for a female therapist.  Are there other options? No?!  I’ve emailed to change my therapist and/ or ask for a refund since I haven’t used their services yet but no response yet. Oh and canceling your account? Well, you have to send an email and then they send you a form and then they have to approve your request. This is infuriating. Bye-bye almost $500 for nothing. seriously just run and don’t try this app. The creators of this app saw an opportunity to make money and are taking advantage of people who need help. This app should not be available here and this company is a scam. 

I’ll update this after I actually get help.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"So I joined a day ago and I can’t even navigate the app? There no way to go back to providers schedules to change an appointment or provider. you end up contacting support who just makes you an appointment weeks out with no regard to if it works for your schedule?! Then they address me in emails by my maiden name with  is odd since I never even gave them that information? I’m also supposed to get charged a fee of $7 per week for the first month yet they charged me $30 .and I can’t even get an appointment for 2 weeks!? That means I pay $60 for nothing since I can’t even see a prescriber. 

Not impressed. I just emailed them on how to cancel my subscription and get a refund. Now I wait to see how hard this will be? The funny thing is they ask about your anxiety level in the app. Well thanks to this program my anxiety is at an all time high!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Everyone seems to have great reviews so I tried Cerebral actually in recommendation of a doctor in my town.  First really easy to sign up… then he’ll for me.  I had to schedule one appointment first then answer questions about everything then had me schedule appointment again cancelling the other.  Then started to receive emails stating I cancelled last appointment and needed to reschedule.  So I attempted to call in to fix it since the system wouldn’t recognize my insurance.  Call in and get an automated system telling me to email support with card.  Emailed support no answer for three days finally called again on the day I was supposed to be scheduled for my appointment and cancelled finding out they don’t take insurance in my state even thought states they can do controlled substances with insurance.  Then get billed the next day for a completed session that never happened and refused to refund me…,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Both my wife and I have been using Cerebral for about 6 months now, and getting our prescribed medications from them is ALWAYS a nightmare. First, we are bounced around between therapists and psychiatrists because they are constantly leaving the service. When that happens, you are scheduled for another appointment 1-2 weeks out. This process repeats weekly and sometimes even every few days, to the point where both my wife and I have gone unmedicated for a month now, because we keep getting rescheduled. If you DO manage to get your prescription, they automatically enroll you to have them shipped to you from a pharmacy in New York, and you have to speak to your psychiatrist directly to request a refill. An extremely inconvenient service that frankly feels like a weird scam, and treats people with mental challenges as less than human. Basically cattle.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"If everything remains steady, Cerebral’s OK.  If you change anything, it all falls apart and no one will help.  After moving to a new state, Cerebral changed me to a provider with no availability for over a month.  Messages to my care coordinator took nearly a week to get a response, and the response was giving me the same provider with the same lack of availability.  Calls to customer service weren’t answered.  If they won’t even respond to you and can’t give you an available provider, what are you paying for? Not worth it.

UPDATE:
As requested in a response to this review from Molly V., “Cerebral Coordinator”, I called Cerebral to speak with her at 11:30 am PT on a Tuesday. After waiting on hold for 12 minutes, I was not able to get through to ANYONE (let alone Molly V.) and was told to leave a message that they would get back to within 24 hours, longer over weekends. See my point, Molly?",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Cerebral is trash psychology. Once they have your credit card number they make it impossible to cancel your account. 

In fact, canceling your account is not even an option on their app or website. When I asked my psychologist & customer service how to cancel they ignored my messages & never replied. I had to google how to cancel it.

Cerebral never helped me with my insomnia. One psychologist made a bunch of promises & I never heard from him again. Another psychologist would speak to me for barely 15 minutes everytime & he kept pushing pills. When I kept refusing his pills, he would get upset, and would be very rude to me. 

Psychology should find solutions to issues someone is having not push pills just to numb a person and give them side effects. I was suffering insomnia, they blamed stress, & it wasn’t stress at all. My hormones were out of balance 

I canceled my account. They wrote back “sorry to see you go.” 2 weeks later they charged my account again & kept my account active. I’m now canceling a 2nd time & they wrote back “Oh we’re sorry, we do have you on record for canceling but we may not give you a refund.

Don’t worry you crooks, I’ve already contacted my credit card, thus will be disputed, & I will get a refund!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I had the medication and care counseling package. I was supposed to meet with both my care counselor and psychologist at least once a month. I only met my counselor once total throughout my entire time as a member which lasted a few months. My psychologist was good, she was patient and gentle in providing care. When I had a dispute I messaged my team but it would often take a while for them to reply to me. Lastly, I cancelled my subscription and didn't use any services in the last month of service and I was denied a refund. They said it was because of the policy but it's flawed, I shouldn't have to pay for something I didn't use. The app itself works great, it's efficient  and easy to use. Overall this service isn't as good as advertised. While it is affordable, the quality of service still isn't worth the price.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I created an account for cerebral because I has suffering from anxiety and depression and no real therapists or psychologists were taking any patients near me. I’ve been a member since September 2021. I’ve had one appointment with the nurse and counselor and I am unable to get a follow up appointment because there is no availability and I can’t get a refill for my medicine. I tried contacting cerebral by the chat feature which is useless because all my messages are ignored, email, and calling the number which is also useless because no one answers the phone. Cerebral has made my condition worse by treating me this way and I still pay $85 a month for them to ignore me. The only instance where someone reached out to me is because my card didn’t go through one month. They only care about you for your money. These people are sick. It’s no wonder they have an F rating on Better Business Bureau.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I had a great first visit with my provider and had high hopes. She even called me back to suggest a different medication than she had originally suggested. I was so impressed! She said the medicine I needed to feel
Better would be to my door in 3-5 days. 

One week later it still hadn’t shipped. I emailed my coordinator and had to write a couple times to get an answer. They had a computer issue and my order was never placed. After losing a week I was frustrated. They reordered my meds and left one off so I had to email again. 

Once the order was set she said I should have it in 5-7 days. What happened to 3-5? 5 days later there was STILL no tracking. I messaged again. They had no idea what happened. I asked if we could have it sent it my local Cvs. And they finally  did that. It cost $10 for two prescriptions from CVS and I was already charged $30 from Cerebral. 

I emailed the cancel account email and communications dropped off Friday afternoon and I haven’t heard back since they asked me to just chose a different provider. I still don’t know if I’m getting my refund of If  I’m being charged for this month. This experience has been laughably horrible. Just call someone local. This service has more kinks than someone with anxiety can stomach.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This company doesn’t do anything to make mental health better. In fact, all they’ve done is make things worse. I’ve tried for weeks to get a hold of somebody and have gotten nothing but the run around. I can’t get onto the app or the website and all o keep getting told us to send an email or call a number. When you call the number, you be told to….you guessed it,…SEND AN EMAIL! What a joke. Even the person on here will probably tell me the same thing. How sorry they are, here’s my generic number that you’ve probably already called ten times, where you’ll be directed to send an email that will get you nowhere. At this point these people have my debit card number and I have no way I getting to it to remove it, and I have no way of canceling. I have emailed their cancellation email too like they’ve suggested. So now they are stealing my money. This is FRAUD! And they need to be reported.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"WORST customer service ever. When searching for mental health services you don’t want the provider adding to the anxiety. That being said, I joined & made an appt & took time off from work, only to have Cerebral cancel my appt due to ‘unforeseeable circumstances’ that started a chain of mishaps as I couldn’t reach anyone by phone (the outgoing message just kept looping and replaying) I messaged my care coordinator and it took hrs and days to hear back. It’s like no one took the time to read my concerns and it felt like i was getting automated responses. All my contact was thru their messaging, not getting a live person to speak to.  Such a disappointment, I would NEVER recommend this service, or actually lack of service and really poor customer service. The whole point of Cerebral is to assist with mental health, they made it worse by the  lackadaisical attitude. Do not waste your money.

1,"I’ve had pretty big issues with no being able to schedule my appointments on the app due to not seeing any availability for my provider. This means I have to call in to set appointments and if that was all I wouldn’t mind but the customer service is pretty bad for a 85 dollar a month subscription. I have had my prescriptions just not sent in and contacted my care coordinator, emailed, and called and have had no response other than “we will work on it” for a few days. I have had appointments cancelled pretty last minute and reminder notifications not sent. The app needs some work and for 85 a month customer service needs to be quicker considering this is medication. Other than that the whole process of getting prescribed is easy and convenient but if you have any issues after it is difficult to get a response.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was so excited for this app. I’ve needed help for some time now and haven’t been able to find an affordable, accessible option. With the discounted first month, I thought I’d give it a try! However, they make you pay before anything else. So I wasn’t able to see that their next available appointments aren’t for over a month. By the time I get to speak with a real person, I’ll have paid over $120 out of pocket. The first month discount is a complete SCAM. 

I tried reaching out to customer service, looking for some guidance or a refund in the least, but no response. I tried to cancel my plan for next month, but there’s no way to do so. I feel so frustrated and upset. I’m using this app because I don’t have the money to spare in the first place. I just want my money back..

I never write reviews, but people who need therapy don’t deserve to go through this additional stress.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I enjoyed my time with this company and did help me with the right steps until I wanted to cancel my service. When I decided to switch to my primary provider and cancel this service. It took about almost TWO MONTHS! Just to cancel. Not to mention I kept getting attempt charges on my server even though customer service keeps saying “it’s scheduled to cancel”. The amount of spam emails you get saying your service is scheduled to cancel is absolutely ridiculous. When you email them, they give you steps on how to cancel in your account profile. However, when you attempt to do it yourself that “cancel button” doesn’t appear. To this point I haven’t even received a cancellation confirmation and needed to change my card information just so I won’t keep getting charged. I would NOT recommend this to anyone at all…",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I really hate leaving bad reviews but I have to do it for this.
At first, this app was amazing. I felt like I was finally being heard and helped. But after my first couple appointments, I heard nothing. For 3 months I wasn’t spoke to or reached out to. I emailed support and asked and they said it’s my job to reach out. I’m paying $85 but it’s my job? I get setting my own appointments but I didn’t hear anything about needing to do the monthly appointments, as my mental health isn’t great, it’s hard to.
The prescription is great and helped so much and I’m scared to lose it and go back downhill again but it’s frustrating to be paying $85 for just a prescription.
I got this app to get help because my own doctor didn’t listen to me but at this point, I don’t know what to do but get my money back to use it somewhere else.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Don’t subscribe. Do yourself a favor and find a more transparent service. Concerns you should listen to:

1. Payments/charges are not transparent. I feel like they are charging my card left and right with no consistent amounts, and now I question what all I’m even being charged for. The cost for their services is not fully transparent. You will spend FAR more money using this service than going to a local doctor’s office. 

2. Can never get an appointment. Each month I’m told I need to schedule my next appointment, only to pull up the calendar and the next available one is 5+ weeks out. Appointments are mandatory and with them being so far out, it truly effects the level of care you’re being provided. 

3. I’ve been a member since mid-October and already twice there was a lapse in time where I was without medications. You’ll receive an email that your meds have been shipped and when you try to click the link to track it, it doesn’t work. Your body will go through withdrawals and this is a consistent thing this company continues to do. 

4. Went to cancel my subscription and you can’t do it through the app or even talk to a live person on the phone, you have to send them an email. Sketch is all I have to say.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up for the basic plan in a state of distress and feeling hopeless looking for something to help me get back on my feet. They make it sound like you’ll get to talk to someone throughout the month if needed but really all they were offering was to provide me a prescription and a basic once a month visit for 30 minutes with an unlicensed counselor. When I realized I didn’t want or need what they were offering I reached out to cancel my subscription and get a refund (they charge you before really telling you what they give you). I didn’t utilize any of their services but was still denied a refund “per the billing policy” (10 page fine print nobody actually reads). Overall just be aware they don’t offer real help at a reasonable price, are deceptive about how they take your money and what they offer, and will take advantage of vulnerable people.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I had trouble scheduling a psychiatric consultation with a Cerebral provider. The app will show you available calendar dates and time slots that are, in fact, unavailable (as admitted by the customer service team). However, while on the phone with customer service, I was reassured multiple times that they secured me with an appointment when they had not. The day of the appointment passed with no correspondence from my provider; the app reflected that I never had an appointment. Fine. I reached out to customer service again and received their voicemail. I tried explaining my problem to the Cerebral team on Instagram and they deleted my critical comment so it wouldn’t tarnish their social media presence. I later received a message admitting that there was a bug in the app and the phone agent made a mistake with my appointment. Avoid Cerebral at all costs.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Originally I signed up with them. I was paying about 89 dollars a month. Then they started charging me 85 dollars and then charging medication charges multiple times on my card, even though on several occasions they forgot to send my medication out, and I ended up having to get an emergency supply at cvs until they responded two days later. For example for September I have a 85 dollar charge, and four 10 dollar charges for medication, when I only am prescribed two medications and I only received one. Also they never let me know of they changed. And when I brought up being charged they told me, well we notified you that you’d be paying less, so that’s why the charges are there. So now at over 105 dollars without even therapy. It’s cheaper to just see a family doctor on something virtual, and letting insurance pay for it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"The app seems faulty and customer service doesn’t seem to know what’s going on. 

I got the services I needed in January but after a few months decided to get off my medication and pause my account. However, I decided to go back on my meds after a bit and got back on the app to restart the services but this time with Medication + Therapy. I clicked on the services I wanted but  the app charged my account twice (I have bank statements to prove it) and I never got the therapy services I requested. When I reached out to their customer service department they say they have no account of these transactions and that my account is still paused. I even met with a provider through their app who prescribed me a different medication but customer service says they don’t see that information on their end.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I had high hopes for this considering it was pretty low pay but I didn’t like that all they wanted to do was prescribe me medication. If that’s what you need then sure. But it was a little sketchy considering you could barely read the information on the bottles and it took almost a week for them to come in when the lady said it should have only taken 2-3 days… I was also looking for actual help on how to pinpoint what causes my anxiety but they told me to just do exercises and journaling and then left me alone for a month. Depending on the plan you choose to take you only get to speak to a counsellor once a month. Again I personally didn’t enjoy that and not being able to get an immediate response when it said it was an open chat. There was three different people I had to speak to (not great for my anxiety) and super confusing to say the least.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"UPDATE: Go take a look at Cerebral on BBB. They’re not accredited and have a 1.16/5 rating by customers. Also to those who have lost money to this scam please go to your bank and file a dispute, also change your card information to avoid being wrongfully charged. This was the only way I got my money back and stopped being charged for services despite filling out their cancellation form. 

Working with Cerebral has been absolutely terrible. I had my appointment cancelled, and ended up having to go through my bank to get my money back. I sent in a form to have my membership cancelled weeks ago and i’m still receiving emails about my upcoming appointment which was cancelled also weeks ago. Kind of shocking they have 4.7 stars, i’m legitimately surprised. As a soon to be PsyD student I would never recommend this company to anyone.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I joined about 5 weeks ago. Set my appointment as soon as they were available. The earliest availability was in two weeks. One day before the appointment, they cancel. They rescheduled and the next appointment was more than a month and a half away. So I wrote to them and they rescheduled for an earlier date about a week out. One day before that appointment again they cancelled it. Now they want to reschedule again and the next availability is two months out. Obviously, unacceptable. Have tried numerous times to reach someone and no one has gotten back to me. I find it ironic, that a service for mental health to treat anxiety, depression and other mental issues can actually be the cause of the same issues you are trying to treat. If you need help, get professional help from somewhere else, but not this app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"BEWARE: they charge you regardless of if you have made an appointment or not, and they provide people struggling with self harm issues an absurd amount of medication at once, as well as not accepting state/federal insurance for medication (despite the medication in question being covered in general)
They do not offer refunds for anything, even if you are charged for an appointment that did not exist. I am very disappointed. The therapist/counselors were very nice, my issues are solely with the app itself. I believe it is preying on mentally ill people and the financially struggling. They even acknowledge that the ""subscription"" type of payment has upset many people in their FAQ , and have done nothing to change it. Charge for appointments when they happen so that people who only need medication management aren't also charged for appointments that never happened or were scheduled.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I had previously met with doctors virtually and assumed this service would be an equivalent after moving out of state but I was very wrong. It's not possible to check if your insurance will cover your care until you have already payed and on top of that you cannot schedule appointments until you've already payed. The earliest I could meet with a prescriber was three months out which makes no sense for a monthly subscription. When it finally came time for my meeting I was told that my mental health history immediately disqualified me from being treated and they couldn't do anything to help me. Afterwards there was no follow up or resources provided as an alternative and the support team did nothing to resolve the matter. These people are not professional, helpful, or caring, just concerned about making money off of people in need and stealing your information.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The service states that if you want to cancel your account, you must submit a request by 9pm the day before your next billing cycle. Knowing this, i submitted my request a couple days even earlier just to be safe. A few days later i was billed again. After reaching out to customer support and emailing back and forth over the span of a week, all they’ve been able to offer me was half of what i was billed. I’ve tried explaining that I cancelled with more than enough time, but keep getting the generic response saying something like, “We try to make sure our customers understand the policy beforehand” and then they explain again that you must request before 9pm the prior day, and then again say they are giving me a partial refund. What is the point in the cancellation policy if the company doesn’t even need to stand by it?",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I used this app to get treatment for depression and ADHD. I wished to return to some safe antidepressants I used to take that worked well but was given strong antipsychotics with no psychotic symptoms. When I told the practitioner they made me feel worse, the doctor was insistent on increasing the dosage until it was at the absolute maximum. I became more depressed and attempted suicide. 

When I saw a different doctor in my inpatient. he told me he could not explain how a practitioner would give me what she did, as it made no sense to him and likely worsened my mental state. I felt incredibly better after slowly weening off these medications, and even better after getting the right ones.

1,"I went through the whole intake process including payment for this service. Everytime I try to log into my account or do anything it says I have not completed my intake and I need to set up an appointment. When I click to schedule appointment, it says there is not appointment availability and they will contact me through email within 48 hours. I get the email that says I haven’t completed my intake and I need to do that, I follow all the linkage just for the same problem to occur. I have been dealing with this for over a week now. I have reached out to customer service but they didn’t answer my question properly and when I said that it wasn’t satisfactory I have not heard back. I am tired of going in these loops so now I have to figure out how to cancel this subscription. Disappointing, I was really excited for this.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"It took MONTHS to cancel a service, where no service had ever been accessed AT ALL. What is being advertised as convenient mental health care access, is in reality a predatory ruse that preys on those who are already vulnerable. One would hope that customer service would be caring and attentive, but instead further worsen the situation by being evasive and just plain rude. To put it simply, the legality of the cancellation policy is borderline at best. If anything, Cerebral is undermining any good that may have come from online mental health care. The last thing anyone struggling with mental health needs, is to be ensnared by a company, and then blamed for having hope in the first place. I guarantee I am not the first “customer” to have this experience, and it is only a matter of time before a class action lawsuit takes place. Was it worth ripping me off for 9 months?",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This is a scam.  Followed up on a refund and this is what they told me:

When you register with us, you agree to your payment method being billed beginning on the date of registration and subsequently on a monthly basis while the account is active, even if you have yet to complete the registration, have a visit with a provider, or start taking any medications. Please refer to our Recurring Billing Policy and Terms and Conditions, which you have agreed on when you signed up.

DO NOT SIGN UP OR THEY WILL CHARGE YOU EVEN IF YOU CAN’T USE THE SERVICE.

Signed up, paid fee (must do before anything), found out they don’t accept my insurance so tried to cancel immediately, process has been a b*tch. They canceled the subscription and they won’t refund the fee even though I asked to cancel right after signing up and never used any of their services. Since they weren’t giving me a refund I thought maybe I’ll try it out but then I found out you immediately lose access (unlike many subscriptions where you still get access until the end of the subscription period). So basically I paid their fee just to find out I can’t use their service. Frustrating and has been giving me more anxiety. Pretty funny for a mental health app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Cerebral is a scam. Do not use it. The contract you sign essentially makes it clear that cerebral is NOT a service but a platform for clinicians to offer their services, which is the same as the majority of platforms. This isn’t inherently an issue, except that cerebral tricks consumers into thinking that you are paying them for comprehensive mental health services. You don’t get the medication prescribed to you? Not their problem. The therapist that they set you up with has a massive criminal record of selling illegal drugs? Not their problem. You realized this service is anything but a service and want your money back so that you can actually go get the help you need? Ha! Good luck with that. I am a physician and hate that so many patients who desperately need help are getting scammed here and receiving care that is so beyond sub par for their conditions. Save your money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Sounds good but limitations abound.

1. Super slow response times from coordinators and prescribers. If you have an issue expect 24 hours minimum for a “resolution.”

2. Cerebral cannot subscribe controlled medications and therefore cannot treat all the conditions, or symptoms of a condition effectively, or thoroughly, even though they advertise that they can treat these conditions with medication.

3. To keep you paying them monthly your prescriptions are only month to month, no more than 30 days of medication provided at a time. Expect a delay if you need an urgent refill.

4. Customer service responses are canned, vague, and unhelpful resulting in unnecessary back and forth to get the information that could’ve been provided initially. 

5. Doxy, the video appointment platform underperforms. Everytime I had an appointment there were issues connecting and with the connect once established even when you are off Wi-Fi and hardwired. 

6. Cerebral cannot prescribe medication outside of the state you live in. If you’re traveling, etc, they can’t send your meds to a different pharmacy like a doctor could. 

Having said all that, I did really like my prescriber. She was great! And the reason for 2 stars.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"My first time booking was perfect, they called immediately and gave me a prescription. (Note that they do not provide controlled substances). Since then: app glitches on scheduling, and I’m unable to schedule on the latest iOS. Whole schedule just shows gray. Meds didn’t work…and I have not been able to get help since. I’ve been writing in for 4 days now and getting a run-around. I also don’t have any evidence that they actually submitted to insurance, as I haven’t gotten a check (my insurance covers it) and in the app it’s saying that it failed to be submitted.

Good idea in theory, but my impression is that it’s poorly run with a high turnover of “care counselors” since ive been on for 2 weeks and am already on my 3rd. I wouldn’t waste the time or money. Go to a psychiatrist office.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I upgraded my subscription to include video services after my first month. I upgraded on January 6th, the day of my renewal, as to not be charged for the previous month. On this day two charges came from my account in the amount of $240 and $315. I was informed that the first charge was for December, and the second for January. I explained that I had upgraded my subscription in my renewal date and was told the best they could do was to refund 30% or my next month for free. Bold of them to assume I would continue service after the issue. This company is taking advantage of its clients and you are better off waiting to see a doctor in your community. I will say my prescriber and care coordinator were excellent. Shame to see that the company doesn’t value their clients but that’s what happens in a for profit medical company in America I guess.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Signed up on a Thursday paid upfront made my appointment for Monday morning. All weekend I was anticipating the appointment and was really looking forward to it. 

Monday appointment time comes the email said to log in 5 minutes before I log in and the therapist doesn’t show up.

I reach out to support like it says in the instructions no response. I decide to reach out to the therapist in the chat and then comes a barrage of nonsense that sent my anxiety through the roof. 

She barely mentions that she blew off our session and makes no effort to make me feel better about that but instead starts asking me about the difference between my shipping address and my living address and asking for other forms of ID; it’s been ridiculous. 

All of these questions should have been sorted out before allowing me to pay for a service, charging me and allowing me to make an appointment creating the false hope that I would get some help.

I’m extremely disappointed and it kind of sent me in a tailspin of anxiety which is exactly what I was trying to avoid by seeking help.

You guys need to do better at this point I think I deserve a refund because the therapist is saying she cannot provide care because of my address and ID.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I’m giving two stars because the prescriber I met with was great. However, the company is quick to get you in for an intake, and then, despite the fact that you’re paying monthly and your prescriber requests to see you monthly, you don’t get an option to meet with them for several months. When you ask for help, they just keep implying that you’re trying to get additional services beyond what you’re paying for and don’t actually help you get access to the services you are paying for. It’s total bait-and-switch and very, very unethical (I say this as a healthcare professional). It’s unconscionable that they would request you pay for healthcare services that you can’t actually access.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up for cerebral in response to an ad for treatment of adult adhd. Unfortunately, the assessments offered were for depression, anxiety and sleep. When I had the appointment with the provider she had no assessment for my adhd symptoms and treated me for depression. I don’t want treatment for depression. I never wanted treatment for depression. It never works and is a complete waste of time and money for me. But no one listened. I was told that I would need to request the adhd assessment and only after the depression medication was allowed 8 weeks to build a therapeutic dose, (longer of therapeutic effect wasn’t reached), would I be assessed for ADHD. I’m 50 years old. I think I know myself better than you do. And all for the bargain price of $80 a month??? $80 a month to have my concerns ignored and be treated for something I don’t want treatment for? No. Don’t waste your time.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"The people on cerebral have no training or options to deal with people who have severe reactions to medications. They prescribe extremely
Serious medication for things that can be treated with something less extreme. They are very nonchalant about prescribing medications that are known to cause extreme side effects in many people, some of these meds even require a dr to monitor your kidneys and liver, but they won’t tell you that. They take an age to answer, and it’s clear it’s just a money grab. Go to a real doctor, this service is dangerous. They completely disregard the risks of the medications they are prescribing, and you can’t reach someone quickly if something does happen to you. 2/10. Medications for mental health are not to be taken lightly. Go to a doctor if you need help, or seek a counselor, don’t sign up for this.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

I was stuck trying to schedule my prescriber appointment and care counselor appointment, even though i already scheduled them, but it never let me move on from that point and I wasn’t able to see my dashboard. They have a lot of issues with their site, and their customer service is slow to respond.

1,"I was told per my prescriber I didn’t need another monthly appointment and that my medication would be filled. They never refilled my medication (which can cause withdrawal symptoms if suddenly stopped), I messaged them several times with no response, I called the number on their site for assistance, it prompts you to select an option for medication refills which then tells you to message your care team, messaged again and no response, the pharmacy tried contacting them and after several days they never responded. I ended up having to go to a local clinic and have my prescription refilled. I paid $85/month to essentially be ghosted by my care team when I needed them. I ended up cancelling my subscription… a tedious process which asks over and over if you really want to cancel… the entire thing is a scam.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They will charge you money that they can’t explain and they will not help you resolve the problem. I was signed up for the $85/month plan, but I kept getting charged $145/month in addition to the $85/month. So they were actually getting $230/month!!! When I called them out on it, they refused to help me. They claimed there’s no record of these extra charges on their end. They said I would have to go through my bank to get help with this. When I went to my bank for help, they also refused to help me because they have been charging me this amount regularly so they don’t believe me when I say this is unauthorized. So I’m just out all that money.

After attempting to tell them 3 or 4 times that my pharmacy doesn’t carry my prescription in tablets and that they needed to prescribe 2 different milligrams in the capsules, we are back to square one again with them trying to prescribe tablets. I am currently supposed to be weaning off of it but now I am going off of it cold turkey because I’m still unable to get this medication. The staff are nice but this is ridiculous. 
Recently I was told that I needed to find a new prescriber somewhere else because they are no longer prescribing controlled substances. I was going to be looking for a new prescriber anyway. I do not recommend cerebral unless you just need counseling.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

I said fine and told him where I wanted my prescriptions sent and even confirmed with him the name of the pharmacy and address. He said they’d be there the next day, that was two weeks ago and still nothing. Apparently he tried to send them to me directly which then charged my bank account the full amount of the prescription which would’ve cost me nothing if I could’ve used my insurance at my pharmacy. And now I’m stuck messaging my “care coordinator” who only replies once a day. This app is a nightmare, do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,I started cerebral on September 24 of 2021. From then I had two appointments with a care counselor in the 6 months I had the app. When you’re trying to better yourself and you barely get to talk to someone it’s hard to work through your problems ESPECIALLY when you don’t even get to talk about them when you’re in a meeting. The only thing I got to talk about was my medication. The only thing I got out of the meetings were articles to read about my mental illness. I’ve been paying out of pocket for this app for 6 months and haven’t gotten any better even in the slightest. I don’t take this lightly and I will be telling other people to find a different app to use. Cerebral is a scam. Spend your money elsewhere for the help you deserve.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"What started out great 15 months ago quickly turned into a nightmare. Initially, my provider and care team were professional, prompt and committed. Within months, I lost both my provider and care counselor. My providers changed more times than I can count. There was no continuity of care, gone were my treatment goals, check ins and supplemental interventions. They were replaced by rushed or canceled visits. Every month I had to ask for my refills, I was constantly scrambling for my, meds. I was dealing with providers who didn’t know, or maybe weren’t interested in, me, my history or my needs. I paid $85 a month to chase down my prescription (which barely changed in that 15 months) and navigate my anxiety without the support of my “care” team. My experience with Cerebral was awful.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up and paid for the service and promptly scheduled the necessary appointments with a Prescriber and a Counsellor. On the date of my first appointment, the Prescriber stood me up without notice. 

After contacting customer service, they told me to reschedule in the app, however, there was no option to do so (which I sent them screenshots confirming). Due to the hassle, I requested that they cancel my account and refund me. Instead of doing that, they just picked a random date and time to reschedule me for that same provider that stood me up. I reached out and again told them that I’d rather cancel and have a refund. 

They then told me I have to cancel my account in the app and asked me if they should cancel my appointment, and they still gave no confirmation that they would refund me. After canceling my account in the app, I reiterated for the third time that yes they should cancel everything and that I want a refund. 

I should not have to ask 3 times to cancel and get a refund and still be unclear if they are doing so. Perhaps the care provided is good if your provider shows up, but based on the customer service I’ve encountered I would be hesitant to recommend this to anyone.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"i dont know where to begin. terrible experience over and over. 
at first the app wouldnt work, contacted support multiple times and it took way too long to fix. 
then my provider told me i can up my dosage and take two. ok thats fine but now i am paying double for my meds. 
a few days before i was going to run out of my medication i contacted support and told them i was going to run out and i still havent received my refill. days go by and im told to send them the address of my nearest pharmacy so i can pick it up myself. i do so and again, a delay in getting back to me. finally they say someone will be in contact with me. its been about three weeks since that and i still havent heard anything. stopping meds cold turkey is very dangerous and is not something i would do on my own. i was forced to do so because of the horrible support. now i feel worse than ever and it seems like they just dont care. this is the worst experience with anything i have ever had. as someone who doesnt usually leave negative reviews, believe that my experience was so bad that i felt the need to leave a review. this is outright dangerous and i am extremely disappointed and angry.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I payed for Cerebal hoping I could make things better since locally it’s hard to even get in with somebody. They even offered a discount that made it $25! Great right? No.. they scheduled all my appointments a month and a few days later (Stupid right? Someone with mental health problems will just sit around for a month before they can even talk to somebody.) and for 2 they charge $85 the next month. My guess is they’re making it look like you’re getting a deal for the first month when really they want you to pay the $85 next month. I don’t have time to wait, and I surely don’t want to rely on an business that functions like this.

Sorry, but this will need a lot of work before it’s ready.

Here’s a update: 
They rescheduled it closer (great!) but when I talked to my provider and told her my problems she said “If you think you’re going to get controlled meds, you’re wrong”... I wanted help not to be portrayed as a pill head.. I don’t understand how this app works. But if you want help, go to someone in person. The counselors are rude, was in her pajamas in her room and hung up on me. I paid to be disrespected and to not get any help. I requested a full refund and I’ll update when I hear back from support.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I wish I could attach a screenshot of the extremely rude and unprofessional response from one of my “care coordinators” my pharmacist was unable to reach the provider after several attempts to refill my medication. I contacted my care coordinators and did not receive a response for more than 40 hours. I called the contact number and the automated message said to message in the app .. very frustrating. I emailed the customer support and also did not get a response back for a day and a half. The response I got back on the app from ‘Bri L’ reminding me that responses can take up to 24 hours… keep in mind theirs was 40 hours later. She then said please don’t send multiple messages. The app was convenient at first but if you have any issues good luck getting in touch with someone.,cerebral-mental-health,,,

and what do you know 3 weeks later im getting another 120$ charge from them. i’ve tried to call i’ve tried to email they don’t respond no one on the phone will talk to me about it because “cancellation questions have to be emailed” so they are just taking me for my money and now the only way i can make this stop is to cancel my bank account and create a new one. scamming ppl seeking mental help is the lowest of the low 🤬",cerebral-mental-health,,,

They take advantage of the fact that people come to they with medical needs in hopes of have access to affordable medication, and they take the money without rendering any services.

Forget about having a constant medication person too, I had a new one pretty much every month I was there and my care coordinator had no clue what they were doing. They also charged me for March when I cancelled well before their site says you need to.

My initial ask for a refund was ignored, and when I followed up I was told I could only get $30/$99 refunded — what exactly did I get charged for?

I contacted support and they said there was nothing they could do, but they would give me 30% off for the next three months of service. Why would I pay to continue not seeing a health professional out of pocket? Finally, I asked to be reimbursed.

Their availabilities are all over the place, and can’t even manage to schedule a flexible appointment for the next month, given that appointments are only half an hour long. Not to mention that if you have a specific prescription with one prescriber, you have to get it refilled by the next prescriber if your first prescriber leaves.

Takes weeks to hear back, and they constantly try to schedule you for absurd times (last request was for 10:30 on a Friday night, previously had some for 5 am). My provider has even missed multiple appointments. They need to hold them accountable when they are providing such an important service",cerebral-mental-health,,,

I’m not interested in even attempting to use the package initially set out to buy after dealing with such a bad customer service team. You guys send out countless text messages to people daily regarding your big discounts but you fail to specify which ones in the texts. 

I’m not saying the service itself doesn’t work or the quality of their services are not being met, I’m saying the customer service and policies they have are comical. I lost money and didn’t even get to use their services whatsoever. Shame on you.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,The concept was great and I was able to get diagnosed and given a prescription but since then its been nothing but problems. My provider has been changed 4 times and they want to try to reevaluate you each time and every time I need my prescription filled it’s a whole process of messaging back and forth to get them to fill it. Horrible communication from your provider on where they are at with filling your prescription. I have yet to meet with a care counselor because every time I make an appointment I get a message saying I have a nee care counselor then have to make a new appointment for at least a month out. Could be a good option for those without insurance with no other options but other than that it’s not worth it.,cerebral-mental-health,,,

As of this writing, I have been waiting over 48 hours for a response regarding a refill with my local pharmacy and am already going through a withdrawal phase.

Then she didn’t show to the second appointment (which was all the way at the end of the month because nothing was available). When I reached out to support for a refund since I didn’t get any service that month (which was completely on them), they refused to refund me because they “do not give refunds even if no service was used”.

And then I have to message my coordinator, telling them know that I literally can’t schedule anything like my to-do list says. Then they schedule it for me, without checking to see if that day & time works. When I signed up over a year ago, I was under the impression that I’d meet with a therapist but turns out I am not.

1,I don’t even know where to start. I’m more disappointed than mad. I suffer from severe anxiety and going out to meet a therapist is extremely difficult for me. Cerebral takes advantage of people in need. Not to mention the limited amount of insurances they actually accept. I have been waiting for over 7 days for my prescription to be filled. I’ve contacted my prescriber and customer service with no avail. Customer service just has a different excuse every time and swears “they’ve sent it to my pharmacy”. My therapist also had me Google what CBT is to see if it’s a good match for me. She couldn’t even explain it herself. She spent our 45min session talked about herself.  I thought i was finally getting help. Save your money and don’t be disappointed like me. All they care about is your money.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I had been seeing ads for cerebral for months saying how helpful and affordable it was. My main reason for trying the service was being able to see a provider almost immediately like they advertise. I made an account and before they give you any real information on services or what to expect, you have to pick a plan and pay first. I paid the subscription and took the assessment and was directed to pick my provider. They offered me only ONE provider and the earliest I would be able to see her would be 6 months from now. So they expect you to pay $80 a month for 6 months without ever receiving services? Mental health services are incredibly difficult to reach out to to begin with and cerebral has made it much harder to hold hope. Waste of time and money",cerebral-mental-health,,,

On top of that, the nurse looked disgusted that he wasn’t the same race as her and fluent in English. She was very rude and cancelled the appointment and disconnected us. She said she would reach out to the care manager to see if they were even allowed to “serve people like him”. Of course she didn’t contact anyone. I had to contact and request help, but no help was provided. And guess what?! These thieves still took over $130 out of my account after refusing service!!!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’ve been paying for Cerebral for a week, but haven’t been able to access information, talk to a specialist, or even move past onboarding. The issue, which requires back and forth with an email support desk somewhere outside of the US to determine, is that they do not have providers but won’t tell you that until after they charge you. Then to cancel, they require you jump through hoops. All the while, you’re paying. I lost my medical provider after 5 years and thought this would be a better way to manage medication. Instead, this platform has led me down a panic attack. If you do a Reddit search, you’ll see this is how they operate; preying on the disabled and lying about their offerings. Stay away!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They immediately begin trying to shove medication down your throat from a 10 minute conversation, it is impossible to get in contact with customer service, and you cannot make an appointment until the next month to get in contact with the care counselor. It seems like they just want your money and the full price for the cheapest service is 82 dollars which costs way more than REAL in person therapy. They gave no information or reviews about the psychologist or the care counselor only a picture of their face. They basically made a decision about you based off of a quiz that is equivalent to a buzzfeed quiz. They don’t know anything about you and do not talk to you long enough to be able to know anything about you or life or how you are doing mentally.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"There is absolutely no urgency or communication amongst coordinators and providers and the amount of pure negligence is astounding. I am at the point of having withdraws from my medication because my provider quit, then they scheduled me with someone who wasn’t authorized to prescribe my medicine. This happened THREE TIMES and each time I had to wait over a week just to get in. The actual app has failed to let me send messages and now it’s saying error when I try to reschedule my appointment. They have no headquarters that you can call and get someone instantly. I was on hold for over an hour before I left a voicemail. You can only communicate via email and they’ll take days to respond. DO NOT GO WITH CEREBRAL. ITS THE WORST DECISION IVE EVER MADE. If you do try it out, do not go with Yael. It’s like talking to an incompetent robot.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I didn’t realize this app is primarily for pharmaceutical solutions and that psychotherapy isn’t part of the primary package. I realized this right after I made my purchase, when the app then gave me an option to upgrade for psychotherapy. I stopped the onboarding process and wrote an email to cancel the service within 10 minutes—I hadn’t even finished registration. They refused to issue a refund and linked to their billing policy. Losing $30 isn’t the end of the world, but I was pretty disappointed in the user experience. It would have been nice if they had shared the different packages with price points before taking my money. Presenting me with an upgrade option for the services I thought I had already paid for definitely felt like bait-and-switch.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was seeking treatment for ADHD. I had a 2 minute phone call with a care counselor who explained the services, and I decided it was not for me. I had already paid for the month, but whatever I knew the risk.

Because I struggle with ADHD I have a hard time remembering anything at all. I forgot to cancel the subscription. I was charged $85 for the second month. The same day I was charged, I immediately canceled and called to inquire about a refund. I was told I would get an email about any refund. 

I had to call the following week again because I received no email. I was then told that I could not receive a refund because I canceled after I was charged. 

I’ve had other subscriptions refund me in instances like this. Yes is my fault I forgot to cancel, but what continues to bother me is that Cerebral doesn’t actually seem to be interested in someone’s mental health as a mental health service. You would think out of all apps/subscriptions they would take into account the reason and maybe be a bit understanding. But they cared more about making $85 than assisting someone who was seeking their services for mental health treatment.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The only positive part of my experience with cerebral was the nurse practitioner who did my initial visit. She was understanding and compassionate.

The customer service and pharmacy are ridiculously slow. It took 2.5 weeks for my first prescription to arrive. Customer service gave me the run around and would not transfer the prescription to a local pharmacy. Prescriptions are not on auto refill so you have to remind them when you need a refill. How is this effective for people suffering from mental health issues?  For my refill,  I requested medication to be sent to a local pharmacy and was told someone would get back to me. Then they went ghost.  I ran out of medication, which is a huge problem. 

Therapy is supposed to be included, I had one 15 min session with someone who told me to do a worksheet. That was 3 months ago. No follow up. No other appointments scheduled by them.  There’s no scheduling option in the app. So I guess you are supposed to contact them to schedule appointments? But again the customer service is lack luster so I’m not even sure how scheduling works. 

This service is lacking a lot!  Overall, this service is not worth it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Signed up and started my intake form. I had one therapist for my whole state to choose from. I could not for various reasons, related to my MENTAL HEALTH, schedule a visit with this person. So that means I didn’t even complete my intake form or setting up my account. However I had already paid the 99$ for the service. Now they refuse to refund me despite the fact that I never even got to use the subscription I bought. I literally cancelled within the same hour that I paid. It’s absolutely ridiculous that I have to pay for something I immediately cancelled. It’s not my fault this service has limited providers. This should be made clear before getting people to choose a plan and pay.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I gave this app the benefit of the doubt and thought I’d not listen to the reviews. I should have listened. I paid $30 for the first month which included care counseling and medication. I met with my provider and within 30 minutes of meeting me I was prescribed two medications. Next day I met with my care counselor and when the appointment hit the 30 minute mark he interrupted me mid sentence and told me to schedule another appointment and that he was now ending the call. So with that happening I decided to cancel. I cancelled my subscription two days ago and today at 9:40pm they charged me an additional $20 for the medications that were included in my subscription which I no longer have an do not want the medications. So I was scammed out of $20 for medicines I’m not even needing and I technically already paid for.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Registered and got to the point where you schedule your first session. Their calendar showed plenty of availability, but for every single one it would say it’s already booked when I tried to book it. Probably just a glitch, but I’m not sticking around when an app-based service has an app that doesn’t work. Not a good sign. Of course, you can’t get to that scheduling point until after paying, so I emailed them asking to cancel my (minutes-old) subscription and refund what they charged. I was told that their terms and conditions state no refunds, but they’re willing to make an exception and they give me a partial refund of $9. Subscription was $30. This company will steal from you and hide behind their terms and conditions.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up and I was not able to see my therapist options until after I subscribed. Once I subscribed and saw my therapist options I only had 2 and neither of them met the criteria I was looking for. I immediately sent an email requesting a cancellation and a refund. I had to ask three times for a refund and when I finally got one they only issues a partial refund of 30%. I never got to use their service, I never even completed their on boarding process yet I am out $50. Tried calling and the people I spoke to said they were not authorized to issue refunds and apparently no one who is authorized is available to speak to on the phone. Total rip off, this was supposed to help my anxiety and did nothing but give me a whole new thing to stress about.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This app honestly just wants your money not for your mental health to get better. I started using Cerebral bc i was referred to it by my sister as she uses it as well. Automatically I thought $85 for monthly and VERY SHORT 30 mins sessions with care counselors and prescribers was ridiculous but I knew I needed the help. They assigned me a prescriber that didn’t have a license in my state which is idiotic and the new one i got was always late and seemed bored with me and just threw whatever medication at me. After a while I faced some financial hardships and could no longer afford it plus i didn’t really like it and cancelled before my next billing cycle started but I am now being told I canceled “too late” and I have an outstanding payment of the $85 and it’s somehow my fault,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This company does not care about your mental health!!! I reached out to their care team over and over again to request a new prescriber and was told I’m not allowed to choose a new prescriber after the initial setup. 

I was assigned someone I knew in my personal life, which is a direct conflict of interest, and they still would not let me choose a new provider!! All my requests fell on deaf ears and we’re not even acknowledged in my first few interactions with them. Took them days to respond to me and over a week to process my cancellation. Never received any care from anyone except for atrocious customer service and still fighting with them for a refund! Absolute trash, do not use this service if you value your mental health.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Upon signing up for service there is microscopic writing saying basically just by inquiring about Cerebral you consent to them stealing $85 a month AFTER a $30 fee for “activation” from you.. even if you NEVER talk to a therapist (which there’s an additional charge to talk to a licensed therapist.)   There is not confirmation page or email receipt. They are internally tricking people into paying for services they don’t realize they are.  They also won’t provide any refunds. Real terrible coming from a company that is supposed to be caring for your mental health.  They also have verbally abused customers for calling out them on their shady actions by telling them to keep their comments to themselves. I’ll be turning them into the better business bureau.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Pros:

- Initial process, first visit, and prescription handling were straightforward

Cons:

- Within a week of onboarding, both the prescriber and the care coordinator dropped from the platform - leaving me in a state of limbo. This is a major issue for a platform developing around mental health.

- Canceling a plan is a hassle. They require submission of an email form, and actual cancelation may cause you to be charged erroneously. Adding friction to cancelation is a cheap trick used by subscription services to “reduce churn”. It often backfires in the long run.

- It’s not possible to view providers without changing to a plan that supports the type of provider you’re trying to find. For example, you’d need a plan including Therapy to search for therapists. If you can’t find a good match, you have to submit a refund request given they already charged you.

Overall, I cannot recommend this product for anyone seeking mental health services. My experience is anecdotal, but two providers dropping as soon as I began using the service doesn’t seem like a positive indicator. Furthermore, withdrawing from the platform is currently a hassle.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They have taken two months of my money and I’ve gotten nothing but more aggravation and stress.  Of the 5 sessions I should have received so far I had one new patient meeting and one no show.  That therapist told me to find someone else! Then a new person who I saw once for new patient meeting and then once again to tell me he’s leaving.  I have received zero actual therapy.  There have been two no show/cancellations out of the 4 appointments I made. 

I have literally spent all day and can’t get them to set the app so I can choose a new therapist so I can hope someone new can help me and show up dependably.  They have my money, I wish I could get the promised therapy instead of more problems. 

There’s no way to reach anyone but messages and the replies are selective- I can’t get any answers about how they plan to make this right.  How to get a new therapist. I swear it’s like a robot answers my messages with the crazy answers I get. 

It’s criminal that they’ve taken my money and worsened my mental health.  go anywhere else, they took my money and have totally failed to live up to even half of their promises.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This is a horrible company. I spoke with a prescriber and given a medication. Then I spoke with a CC & then they gave me a new prescriber in her notes there was many factual errors regarding my situation in addition she lied about things we had discussed then she dropped me as a Clt saying I was “on too many meds” I am on meds for a disease I have I have been on these meds for years including when I spoke with the first prescriber and counselor. Considering I suffer from major depression dropping me like this adds to the Depression & puts me in danger of withdrawal from dropping the meds they had given me just like that. This prescriber sounded like she was annoyed to be assigned my case & had a lousy attitude I suggest you use a different company as this one is awful,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I subscribed to and paid for Cerebral. I met with a prescriber, and she was fine. I met with a mental professional and we had a terrible connection (not her fault) but she kept muting me to yell at her kids (totally her fault and unprofessional). I cancelled my acct well before my April renewal charge and then realized in May that I was still charged for both April and May. After a lot of back and forth- why have a hotline because NO ONE ever answers, I was issued a refund. The worst part was that I had switched which card was my form of payment and they charged the original card that was not “on file” anymore, which is so shady. After multiple assurances from multiple people that this would never happen again, I was charged in June. I’m reporting them for fraud.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"It’s been a while since I have used cerebral. I thought it was going to be a great app because I needed some help and why not use an app on a device I use constantly?

Because they charged me for my second month then when I went to cancel they couldn’t send my meds. I get it. It’s sketchy to send meds when you’re not paying for the service but the thing was I paid for the month. The customer service rep I spoke to didn’t say anything about canceling causing medicine to not be delivered. I was also seeing my doctor for the meds so it wasn’t like I wasn’t seeing ANYONE for it. 

No refund. No meds. Nothing. Just money out the door and hey, gotta do what you gotta do. At this point, it’s blatantly obvious that the company does not care for mentally I’ll people, which is a shame because this was the recommended app for me. 

Maybe communication amongst your subscribers would be best. At this point I can’t say how much I spent that I didn’t get back because it’s been a hot minute since using cerebral. Not a day goes by that I don’t miss it. 

DO NOT RECOMMEND

*if this review gets deleted, please know it’s not my doing*",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I have been a member 6 months and talked to a subscriber a few times and after twisting arms finally got one counseling session. I pay so much money and there isn’t really a treatment plan. As soon as I can find something else I’ll go. I’m tired of feeling like this and having to fight for help every month makes the treatment I’m kind of getting much more useless. Cerebral is an added stressor in my life really. I asked for a new team altogether a week ago and still no resolve. Even when things get escalated to a higher member of customer service it’s still awful. They don’t take a lot of insurances and it just isn’t good. If you truly need help not here if you need a subscription for medicine discreetly maybe but there’s probably cheaper options.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This service is just as bad as circle medical. It’s not easy or straightforward to get in touch with your prescriber. In 4 months, I’ve been assigned 3 prescribers total. Each time i went to make an appointment I’d have to request a special link from the care coordinator, whom also changed up multiple times in my short experience with Cerebral. 
After each appointment I’d have to follow up to get my prescription, which left gaps in my medication. What am i paying for if i have to do all this extra leg work just to get one prescription filled every 30 days???? Honestly switching back to in person providers after this less than ideal experience with Cerebral (after trying Circle medical which is even less together).",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This is my last resort in trying to get someone from this company to reply/contact me. My doctor recommended trying this service and I was thrilled at first. My insurance processed and I was set to go until I received an unexpected charge. I emailed, called, and tried to message my care coordinator. The phone number provided for customer support just walked me in circles with automated choices before hanging up. I never got an option to speak to someone. I sent an email for clarification which resulted in my subscription being cancelled. I lost $300+ to this company and couldn’t reach anyone for help to resolve the issue or get a refund. I genuinely wanted to use this service because of the good word. I just need someone to help get my account back on course.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I wonder how these people became nurses or doctors because essentially they can’t help people. They turn away people. They lack professionalism. They don’t send in ANY scripts when YOU the customer paid for a service. Now tell me, does that sound like real help, or a real SCAM?? Because I’m going to tell you, I was scammed, no scripts sent, and I bet I NOT the only one. Proof— look at the other horrific reviews. ***DON’T GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO TAKE YOUR MONEY & REFUSE SCRIPTS!! I saw a psychiatrist who was nurse practitioner so low in IQ she didn’t know how to work the video chat, DOXYME so it got cut to a phone call. Now customer service is ignoring me. WHY? Because this whole online CeReBRAL APP does not help people. The good reviews are fake, believe it or not. Read the 1 and 2 star reviews— that’s the truth!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Hi friends! I don’t post reviews that often, but I am very passionate about mental health care. I wanted to take a quick second to warn you about Cerebral. Cerebral is an website that offers “Online prescriber visits, care counseling, and prescriptions delivered to your door.” What they don’t tell you is that you will never be able to connect with your care team, your psychiatrist, or their support team. You will pay money to be ignored, particularly when you need help with med management and crisis. You will not get a refund. Please do not fall into their trap. If you need help finding resources please do not go with Cerebral. Stay healthy, stay aware. This has been a public service announcement. Please learn from my mistakes. 😅",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This program seemed great initially, but has turned out to be a scam. The Cerebral prescriber would not prescribe for me and suggested I find a local in-person provider instead. I therefore asked for my Cerebral record to take to my doctor and have not been able to get this no matter how many people I ask or how many times. It’s been weeks. I have contacted the prescriber, counselor, coordinator, customer service, over and over, and am getting nothing but runaround. I honestly think they are stalling so that I will be forced to pay for month 2 of the app. Month 1 is charged at an intro rate and month 2 is more than twice as expensive. I am disgusted with this rip-off and cannot believe I have to fight for my own records.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,I had signed up because I wanted to use the therapy features. I already had a psychiatrist so that was all I really needed. I had scheduled an appointment and began the session and the lady said that therapy isn’t allowed in my state yet and there was no features that I really needed at the time. She still took my health info just in case it was needed in the future which took like 10-15 minutes. I had contacted support and asked for a refund since I paid $40+ for essentially nothing and they said no because I “utilized the services”. I’d say just make sure you know what you’re getting completely before signing up.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"In the beginning the app was great. Scheduling and meeting with both prescriber and counselor were very simple and easy. It was way too good to be true. They now seem severely understaffed. I’m always being tossed around to different prescribers and counselors and scheduling appointments is impossible. They make you reschedule but don’t provide any dates and they take forever now to reply. Nothing is consistent. They just want to take peoples money without giving them the proper care they actually need. They act like they will schedule you an appointment but cancel the appointment last minute. It’s really annoying. This is people’s mental health they’re messing with. By being unresponsive, they can potentially harm a lot of people.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I had so many issues with this membership, from app glitches, to nonexistent communication. 
For starters, I only used this membership for about 3 months. The first month, my prescriber changed on me, then my coordinator switched as well. Second month in, my coordinator switched yet again, and my counselor bailed on me the day before my appointment. 
Third month in, my coordinator was constantly switching up because the one I had wasn’t available nearly every week. And yet again, my counselor canceled my appointment the night before. 

What was my last straw, was that my prescriber left me in the back burner and quite literally left me without medication. 

I read all of these reviews in the beginning and thought, “maybe I’m being too critical and just need to try this for myself.” 
No, I was listening to my gut and chose not to follow it and this is where it landed me. 
I now use Dr. On demand, and it’s 10x better, they even gave me a 3 month prescription of my medications AND it’s cheaper and offers more/better services. 

Please listen to me and avoid this app/company as best as possible.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I have been with cerebral for 5 months now and every month there is a problem with my prescriptions. They are a controlled substance and messes me up when I do not take them as directed! Also I start with all of the side effects all over again when I go without them for 3 or more days which happens every month! Either the pharmacy won’t take the prescription or the prescription wasn’t entered in right etc. it takes a hole day or more to get in contact with the prescriber! I have tried to wait it out and hope everything can be straightened out and not continue to happen because they are convenient but it has yet to get better! I will be looking for a doctor near me!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up for therapy and the prescriber initially. They didn’t have any therapists available so I had to switch my subscription to the basic plan. I love my subscriber but when I reached out why I had been still charged the full amount of therapy even though the subscription changed that day, they were unbelievable rude and unhelpful and told me that is was my problem but because it was a subscription service there wasn’t anything they were going to do. There so called care counselors didn’t know anything and were never helpful when I reached out by something that seemed pretty basic. Do yourself a favor and don’t use this platform because they don’t really care about mental health. Just making money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Everything started out great then I needed to taper off my meds to switch to another medication. I was pretty much ghosted after that and my refills were at zero. I couldn’t get in contact with anyone about scheduling something with a psychiatrist. Literally so overpriced, 85 dollars a month for you guys to just leave me hanging? I moved on to Redbox rx. So much more affordable and easier to get in contact with a prescriber. Even though I moved on I haven’t been able to cancel my cerebral membership. They keep telling me there’s a cancel button but there isn’t lol. How many times do I have to email and tell you guys this? I’m hoping at some point when you’re not receiving my payments you’ll cancel my membership.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Used this service for a whole month and never saw anyone due to the sessions getting cancelled repeatedly by the counselor. Response times were horrific. Everything about this app felt robotic and impersonal. Never got a refund either. I live in an area with a small amount of mental health professionals. Apps like these prey on the mentally ill by offering sub-par services. Small Update: still have yet been able to contact anyone about my issues. They really just took my money and ghosted me. It wouldn’t surprise me If cerebral has caused suicides due to intense frustration. Even a response from the developer would be a miracle at this point. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT CORPORATE MENTAL HEALTHCARE COULD GO SO WRONG SO QUICK? I wish I could leave a rating lower than one star.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I wanted something similar to the website where I get my birth control and thought this was a good idea. Incorrect. I needed mental help when I asked for it and still do but the best they could do was May. So I found a facility closer and cheaper and told them I wanted to cancel my order and be issued a refund as I have not been rendered any service. I’m on a waiting list. They refuse to give me a refund of the thirty dollars I have spent and yet I haven’t received the first bit of help. When I did have questions I would try and type them to the person that was assigned to me and sometimes it would be 24-48 hours for a response as well as the response showing up at ridiculous times of evening. Very very unsatisfactory. Do better.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,So first off we will start off on how rude the care team that is given to the client upon set up of the account. During business hours I wasn’t able to get in contact with any of the care providers meaning that in general they would not reply to me when I messaged them. But rather reply during very late hours of the day. So I would wake up and I would try everyday to consult one of the providers. Numerous times I was ignored assumingly due to age discrimination. I suffer from ADHD/Anxiety so the medicine prescribed was suppose to pose as a trialed substance that would be possibly increased based on the affect it would have on my mental disorder. This app does not pose as a good candidate for anyone who is experiencing serious problems. And in need of help.  A scam.🤷🏽‍♂️,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,My coordinator told me my refill would be sent in YESTERDAY to my pharmacy. I called both of my pharmacies and they had not received anything. They also couldn’t send a request because one of my prescriptions is a narcotic. I am going through a withdrawal from my anti anxiety meds and my adhd meds because YALL made me. I reached out to them yesterday asking to have it sent over asap and have not received a response as of this morning. This is so unprofessional and appalling. THAT IS DANGEROUS TO DO. You could seriously INJUR someone by making them go through this!!! What is wrong with y’all?! I will be cancelling my services immediately. Thanks for a waste of 85 dollars a month.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This service/app is a 100% scam. It is NOT mental healthcare it is designed to steal money and time from vulnerable people. Stay far far away. 

 signed up today and set my intake appointment for 6:30 local time. At 5 local time I received an email that I was a “no show” so my appointment had been canceled. This, of course is not physically possible as it was 1.5 hours ahead of my scheduled time. I tried to reach out through multiple channels but did not receive a response to this concern. 

A few minutes later a man calling himself Kai, called and said he was a prescribing provider and could do my appointment now. I explained that I am now very hesitant to trust this system given that my appointment was canceled without warning or explanation and now I’m getting a call out of the blue from a name I don’t recognize at a time I didn’t ask for. His response was to ask if I was ready to move forward with the appointment or if I wanted to “just keep complaining”. Really!? This is how a supposed mental health care provider speaks to people!? I’m horrified and appalled. 

100% scam. Run far far away.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have had many bad experiences with apps and I have NEVER went out of my way to write a review. Please don’t take this risk unless you literally have money to throw out the window. I signed up for the $30 first month and that money was literally stolen from me I got absolutely nothing, the doctor didn’t show to appointment even though i cleared my schedule and was so anxious about FaceTime. They won’t give me that money hack. Next month will be $85 and it is SO HARD to cancel. I’ve been in touch and I’m hoping it’ll go through where I won’t be charged.

1,"I signed up over a month ago and have yet to speak to a therapist. 
Within the first days I was being contacted, I was able to make an appointment 4 weeks from my sign up day. Then the therapist canceled after 2 weeks and everything went down hill from there. I wasn’t getting responses how to go about making a new appointment, the coordinator made an appointment for me during my work hours when I requested evening appointments. I asked to reschedule and they made another daytime appointment. No one would get back to me, then finally a “Clinical Associate” texted me that there therapy services were at capacity with my insurance. So this online service charged me and my insurance for texting me and wasting my time for 5 weeks.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I can not access the account because it continues to try to get me to speak with a provider even though I’ve already done that. So, I’ve clicked “continue onboarding” it just takes me to my browser and tries to get me to speak with a prescriber. However! Instead of taking me through the process I’ve already done it just gets stuck on a screen that you can’t click on. If that doesn’t happens it asks you to download something that you can’t even download. I feel like I’ve wasted my time and my money with this. Also, the conversation with the prescriber feels like getting way too personal with a telemarketer who wants to push medications on you.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I’ve been a member for 2 and a half months now and the people I’ve managed to speak to have been great. But I have a lot of problems with the platform. In the 10 weeks I’ve been a member, 4 of them I haven’t been able to speak to a clinician because they cancelled my appointments the day of. I have been moved between five providers after I told them I needed to speak to someone about side effects I was experiencing. It’s been 6 weeks and still I have not been able to speak to someone about this issue. For a platform geared towards helping with mental health I have never been more frustrated or felt like a company didn’t care.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The services did not meet my needs. A month later, they still haven’t cancelled my account. I sent the email request, I waited for the response and filled out the separate form. Weeks later, I haven’t gotten confirmation of the cancelation. They are going to attempt to charge me again next week, I’ve had to dispute the last charge with my bank. I haven’t actually used the services since January, and understand February is my responsibility because I made no attempt to end the service then.

1,"I requested two months ago to have my prescription shipped from the pharmacy of my choice rather than their in-house pharmacy, which I had previously been getting it from. They claimed they would take care of it for me. Instead, they have now charged me $60 for medication that should have cost me $6 had they done the right thing. And I haven’t even gotten any of it. None of the packages have made it to my home. Nor did I know to be watching for it to arrive, because I’ve been working with the pharmacy I selected, never dreaming they were continuing to charge me for medication from their pharmacy WHEN I SPECIFICALLY ASKED THEM NOT TO.

1,I’m finally getting help and when signing up the app made me go online and do it again and made two profiles with one email some how and charged me twice. Tried to change my email to see if that would do anything and now I can’t get into the app whatsoever. Plus since I talked to my prescriber on my “first” account I can’t see the prescription and I have a appointment for next Sunday with a care counselor but I can’t se that date and time except for the appointment I made on “second” account. The prescriber even saw two accounts and told me she’d tell her side. I’m incredibly frustrated. I just want help finally and all this is doing is making it worse and already taking a big effect on my mental.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,After the terrible service I had with them I still can’t cancel. The app only has an upgrade option and so does the site after I login. I finally found an email to request to cancel and I got a response with a “test” asking irrelevant questions to cancel my subscription “what subscription do you have” so I get that wrong and I can’t stop you charging my card? Imagine Netflix creating 6 questions in a 10 step process for you to cancel and after that It’s STILL not canceled. I got an email (not automated) from a worker saying they will follow up with the process. So far it’s been 10 steps to have this app stop charging my account. Not sure how this is legal.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up and paid before I was able to schedule with anyone, upon scheduling I found out there aren’t any available appointments until next month. 

I understand that there’s a limit of available people, especially since so many are having more mental health struggles right now, but it feels bad that a) I have to wait a month until I can talk to anyone b) that the sign up process is set up so I didn’t know how long I’d have to wait until after I had already paid and given all my information c) that I paid for this month when I don’t get to talk to anyone yet. 

It feels a little deceptive and it’s disheartening when so much of the draw for Cerebral was supposed to be the ability to see someone quick and clear straightforward communication and pricing. 

If there’s any way I could speak to someone sooner or have my fee for next month waived I’d really appreciate it. 

Thanks for your help

2,"Cerebral has the potential to be a really great service, but I don’t think it’s all the way there yet. I’m pretty shocked there’s no preferred name option honestly, I know it’s detrimental to my mental health to log in and see my birth name every time so I can’t imagine how people in worse situations feel.

My care counselor has missed a few meetings without explanation and there’s no option as a user to schedule an appointment without being prompted. If the counselor misses you won’t be prompted.

It’s also worth mentioning that care counselors do not offer therapy. You have a care counselor but don’t expect to discuss any deep issues, appointments are only 30 minutes and very surface level. I don’t even bother scheduling those appointments anymore. 

That being said, my prescriber has been amazing so I’m seeing this through a bit longer. If they add scheduling, longer appointments, and preferred names they could be 5 stars. I truly want to have a more positive experience in the future.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The app itself isn’t bad, but the connection with the calls was awful. And I didn’t really feel like I got what the service kept advertising, and you have to cancel via email, and is really tedious. There was literally nothing I got out of it and didn’t ever get refunded, didn’t get an actual apology or follow up or anything that wasn’t automated. It’s just frustrating trying to troubleshoot stuff on your end and it not working, and then it’s just a waste of money and time. So, all my stuff was canceled and stopped without even using it for more than 5 minutes, but they took my money. There’s definitely better options in person or elsewhere.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I originally wrote a review about how it was extraordinarily difficult to cancel services with Cerebral. I did finally manage to get the subscription cancelled, only to be hit with a surprise $85 charge a full 12 days after cancellation confirmation. I’ve had to file a chargeback with my bank and report the company to BBB. I will forever spread the word of this scummy company and it’s predatory practices.

Cerebral preys on those with mental illnesses who will not stand up for themselves or those who’ll easily forget the recurring monthly fees. Please be aware that there is also an attorney/law company looking into Cerebral and this exact predatory practice. If you have a story like mine, please search for the litigation through google or Reddit!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They will literally take your money and not deliver your meds but refuse to give you a refund because ‘the meds already shipped’. You can’t tell if they did or not because you can’t get a tracking number. Your meds will also be late. I put up with them for three months and my meds were days late each time. When I asked them to send the RX to a local pharmacy, they said they would but failed to do so that time and the other two times I asked them to. They also charged me for both RXs when my dosage went up???

It was a mess. I still don’t have a refund because their support is so poorly trained and just bounces you around. So I’m out over $120 on the missing meds alone.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have had this app since the end of November and have had three different appointments cancelled and have been pushed out months. Basically a scam to charge you monthly without really offering any services. The “therapy” is just someone who listens to you and then emails you articles to read. Nothing to be gained from it that you can’t figure out yourself with a (free) Google search.

In theory this app is a great idea for those struggling to maintain their mental health around a busy schedule. As a full time student and employee with a 70+ hour workload each week I was excited to have a convenient option for therapy and prescriptions. However this app has proven to be more frustrating than it’s worth.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Started a subscription for medication management. They stopped sending my meds without warning so after experiencing some dangerous withdrawal symptoms I started paying to see someone else. Only to find out months later that cerebral was still charging me monthly for “medication management” because “I never cancelled”. Like the rest of the American health care system, it’s just a money making business. Not at all about helping people.  I asked for a refund since I was being charged even though THEY stopped “managing medications” leading me to believe I had been cancelled but of course, that’s not their policy. Their policy is get that money and hold on tight to it!  No services required in exchange for the money either!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This company is a fraud and scam, I signed up they charged my card. Had 1 appointment and they offered prescription. Appointments with anyone was past the month of service I paid for due to lack of availability. They charged my card again couldn’t get anyone on the line or email although I was confirmed to have canceled well before charging. They claimed that I received something I never received. I had to file a report with my credit card company and blocked the merchant. The appointments I had scheduled said they canceled due to the employees leaving the company. Seems like this whole company is fake. If you’re looking for mental help this will make it worse believe me. I’m out close to $100 for nothing.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"My fiancé has been contacting Cerebral for several days to cancel & get a refund. We were charged $115 and have not had even one session. No response. Called the only number we could find, only to get an automated message stating that if it is in regards to refunds that we must send an email. Second email was sent, no response. Considering this is a mental health company it would be superb to be able to speak to someone when necessary…to be able to get our money back, in order to not add to his everyday stressors. I’ll continue to reach out in any way possible until we receive a reply/refund. I cannot get behind a company that has terrible customer service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I had the same issues with the prescription as most of the other complaints. The prescriber was kind and attentive during our session, however, I never received anything and it was never sent to the pharmacy she assured me it would be sent to. Also, my coach wasn’t the best. She spent most of our session talking about herself. Also, I looked on the BBB after reading several negative reviews on here talking about people who felt they paid for services that they never received. They’ve mostly been resolved once being taken there in case anyone is having trouble getting their refunds. Betterhelp is more expensive, but so far, a much better option for me at least",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was unfortunately unable to attend my first visit despite all my efforts, due to technical difficulties with my wifi. Within the first 10 minutes of the 30 minute appointment I rescheduled and called cerebral directly to do everything I could to get my account taken care of. Unfortunately, they could not understand my situation and charged my account both for a missed visit (30$) and the initial account charge (15$) and will not refund anything. I have not used a single service provided by this company and even after doing everything I possibly could do to cancel in a timely manner I was still charged. I am now even more anxious than before- thanks cerebral.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I had high hopes after reading reviews, but I have not been able to get a therapy appt until week 3. So I’m paying for features for two weeks that don’t mean anything to me. There is only one therapist in my insurance network and his schedule is very limited, so I most likely won’t get weekly appts. He has not answered a query about if he ever has cancelled appointments. I wonder how invested he will be in my counceling if he is that busy. Obviously this is speculation, since we have not talked. My insurance covers therapy, so if these features I am paying for aren’t effective then they are not worth it. I am becoming skeptical the longer I was, I have to admit.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Prescribed me the wrong prescription for 2 weeks somehow. Beware! They make it sound like everything will be seamless & fast. This is not usually the case. I found an amazing therapist & that is the only thing keeping on the app. My prescriber keeps changing, leaving the company, or is completely unavailable for months & has to be reassigned & I am forced to start over month after month. My prescriptions can take over a week & I constantly have to correct them & follow up on my behalf to me sure things are getting done. Not sure what the care coordinators do. They keep giving me false information & dragging out every interaction. Very frustrating & very pricey.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I had this service for a couple of months, let’s start with what went on BEFORE I asked to cancel.
My appointment was ALWAYS listed in the wrong time zone, leading to panic attacks from me thinking I’d miss my appointment. 
I CONSTANTLY got emails and texts from them to fill out a medical history form, when I already had done so. I would then go to the app or online to do it again and it wouldn’t be there. Developers said to just ignore it. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO, just fix it!

Now, I recently moved and my insurance switched so I could no longer afford the service. I asked my care team on the app to cancel my service, apparently they messaged back saying they couldn’t do it and I had to fill out a form. I did not see the message come through and thought nothing of it (partially my fault for not checking). I got charged on the first of this month and they refuse to refund me even though I haven’t used the service since November AND asked to cancel weeks before the renewal time. 

Don’t get this app, it’s not worth the trouble or the cost.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"At the end of the day, this company (or app) is a business. They will prioritize making money over your mental health. This company refuses to give me a refund after I canceled my account. They charged my account two days after I canceled, then said I should of canceled when the billing cycle started. Didn’t stop them from taking my money anyways, even though the company, the customer service rep and my own therapist knew I canceled the service days prior to me getting billed. Don’t even get me started about the customer service, they don’t care. Don’t use this app or service, it’s not worth the asking price of $259.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Stay away from these folks. Cerebral does not hand insurance claims well, and when they mess up, they shift blame to the customer and their billing policy. They will not refund money, but they will surprise charge you with hundreds of dollars in bad insurance claims. They only file claims every few months, so you won’t notice until after a few months have passed that claims were filed wrong. My insurance is backing me up, Cerebral told me they couldn’t do anything because of their “policy”. This is what predatory businesses do, lock you into a service, shift blame to you so as to charge you more for non-rendered services, then claim their policies won’t allow for refunds or cancellations within a normal time frame.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Unlike BetterHelp they will absolutely not give you a refund whether you use their service or not. They don’t clearly don’t care. I was desperate to talk to someone therapy wise and “upgraded” to medication and therapy, only to find no therapists available and my card charged $300. I made an appointment with a provider and she was cold and made me cry. After prescribing me something, it showed up in the app but then disappeared after a day. The chat feature online and in the app crashed so I lost contact to the “care coordinator”.
I went to Lemonaid to get a prescription so I could start something and they were fast and the nicest I could have wished for after being ripped off $300.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I never used the service, but made the mistake of linking it to an account so it received payment information. I never verified my identity because it really was on a whim that I even clicked to learn more. I tried to contact the service and cancel so that they’d stop asking me to verify my identity and they said they couldn’t and that if I hadn’t fully enrolled then just unsubscribed. I unsubscribed. They charged me. I contacted them and said my identity wasn’t even verified, they said they know but they are happy to cancel. I said I asked for cancellation before I was ever charged. They said here’s 1/10th of the total amount we’ve charged to your inactive account back. Zero stars. Zero service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Waited a month to talk to someone only for them to be dismissive and not listen, at one point she told me I “wasn’t giving her any information” despite me sitting there with a written list my therapist and I had worked on to explain where I’m at and why I feel I need medication. She didn’t listen and kept treating me like an idiot, I could tell from a minute in she’d made up her mind and wasn’t going to listen to what I was saying. If this is the caliber of people employed by Cerebral I suggest you run fast the other way. What a heartbreaking waste of time and shame on them for employing people who clearly don’t care and are in a position to make things worse for someone struggling with mental health.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The sign up process is confusing, and really only geared to those who already know the therapy and medication world. They also don’t offer refunds if their sign-up process gets it wrong.

Their signup process told me they accepted my insurance but neglected to say it didn’t accept it for therapy, which is all I wanted. It pushed me into a meeting with somebody who could only prescribe medication, which I didn’t want.

Their app and website are also riddled with bugs, and I hit just about every one while signing up. This service is a hot mess, but if you want easy meds for a $30/month doctor visit fee (with insurance - this is not counting the medication cost), yeah go for it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I had high hopes for this one. 

I was looking for an alternate treatment since is best mot to expose myself with all this craziness out there. But this app and service is a disaster. You don’t get any help until you speak w a counselor and the waiting period to get an appt is ridiculous ( more than my in person therapist) after waiting for a month the counselor didn’t even show. No much to do on the app to help you. Not sure how this is helpful. They were quick to charge my acct but no service was provided at all. Every time I read a msg is “sorry” if counselor doesn’t join in 10 mins. Sorry support is delay, sorry cancellation is delay. 

It’s just ridiculous. If you need true help look elsewhere.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Absolute mess. I rarely review things. This was nothing but problematic. 

1.  Gave me meds.  I tried and kept literally passing out.  When I wasn’t, I would fall asleep sitting, driving, I couldn’t function. I told them multiple times.  Always “asking someone” but never got back to me.  Went to a real doc and they were horrified that I was put on that with my other meds and said it could have really been serious. 

2.  Constantly changing “care team” who isn’t reliably keeping either appointment times or is just changing non stop.  Every three days a new message that I have someone new on the team as someone else changed out. 

3.  Refusal to cancel account without a bunch of hoops.  Had to close my debit card because that was the only option when they wouldn’t stop billing me. 

4.  Customer service is only email and comes with a side of attitude.  

Avoid.  It cost more to fix this and in the billing after I cancelled than the actual doctor I saw cost.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I absolutely loved how quick responses were at the beginning of my services, but now that it’s been a year, I’m kind of left to the dogs. Whatever medication shipping service they use keeps getting blocked at my state’s USPS facilities so I end up going a week without medications unless I have them send the script to a local pharmacy. 

They told me that I have to be the one to remind them to refill my prescriptions every single month and it takes them a couple days to do it. The therapy was good until my therapist left for Mat leave and I haven’t had anyone great since then. Honestly, not worth the money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I've been rescheduled providers and counselor more times than acceptable on this service. They get you on these medications just to make it impossible to get refills so that you can get stressed out more than what the app is intended to solve. It takes days for someone to respond and they usually usually say sorry for taking a long time but we still don't have an answer for you 🤷🏻. I've been getting the run around for almost 2 weeks now just to get my medication refill. If you actually want help with ADHD just go to a real doctor. These people are phoney. It's like having the worst doctors office in your pocket. If you like those headaches then sign up!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I fill my prescription at CVS pharmacy through Caremark and I have trouble every time because they want a 90 day prescription and I pay full fee as a result of Cerebral’s policy of not allowing 90 day prescriptions. 
Then they switched my prescriber on me. I ran out of medication and asked for a bridge prescription to get me until my next appointment with my new prescriber. It never happened. I ran out and experienced withdrawals. After two days without I finally used Teledoc to get a refill because I couldn’t rely on Cerebral to take my medication seriously enough. 
This is insanity. I will have to switch to seeing a local therapist.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I sent an email to cancel as directed in the app. There was no mentioning with-in the app of a questionnaire that I would be required to fill out after. It fell into my Junk Mail and a month later I was billed again. I asked for a refund of the charge that was just billed and they only offered 30% refund despite never using their service once. It’s a system setup to scam you for an additional month.  Their response was “ it’s outlined in the terms and conditions” who is going through and rereading the terms and conditions that you agree to when signing up for the app when requesting a cancellation? It’s a sham.. I’m assuming they eventually get class actioned for this.,cerebral-mental-health,,,

I’ve tried to contact the prescriber several times over the last week and have gotten no response. If I had a severe problem, I would not have been able to get help in any kind of timely manner. I had to resort to scheduling another appointment just so I can get a message to the prescriber that there was a mistake with the prescription. Not only has this not helped, it’s made me lose more hope because I attempted to get help when I really needed it, and I’m still waiting.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"1. They charge you upfront for accessing the service. Then, you have an appointment and the doctor prescribes the medication. It’s been 72 hours and I have spoken to 4 different people who can’t chase down where my medication even is. 

2. I called and messaged - finally get a response and they say it’s still being “prepared” but no clue when it’s going to be ready. I asked to just have it sent to a local pharmacy - no response. 

3. They were supposed to schedule a follow-up appointment. Nobody reached out. I just gave up and thought of the fee I paid upfront as a sunk cost. This place is a scam - no doctor in the world would be this irresponsible with patient care.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I got this app with high expectations for mental healthcare - had to wait a couple weeks for my scheduled appointment with my provider, as expected. A week before my appointment a care rep from Cerebral reached out and told me they rescheduled my appointment for the 2 days from then, and a few hours before that appointment the provider cancelled on me without any notice or explanation. Now I can’t get an appointment for another five weeks and Cerebral customer care can’t be bothered to respond to any emails. I really want this service to be good and to work for me but between the providers cancelling and the customer care ignoring me I’m not sure I’ll ever get to use it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I had high hopes when I signed up but there was no substance after the first week or so. Medication took up to a week to arrive, there were technical issues in accessing lessons and keeping appointments. I told them I wished to cancel but they charged my credit card $85 anyway for a month in which I am receiving nothing. The last prescription that was sent to me was for a medication no doctor ever talked to me about and came 10 days after I contacted my team for help. How they arrived at the medication for me is very scary. Who is in charge of being sure medication is appropriate?
I found them unreliable at best and am very happy with a different online service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I got excited and started to use the program with medication and therapy. I was a min late and the therapist refused to talk to me and made me feel rushed and like she didn’t care. I decided to give her another chance and reschedule. 

 I made it to the next one and told her I was waiting for a dr appointment (since I was sitting in my car. Didn’t want her to think I was driving) and she refused to talk to me. Thinking we wouldn’t have time to talk when I said we would (I was early for my appointment)

I went to cancel and asked for a refund since I had a bad experience getting in and treated me like I didn’t matter. I shouldn’t pay for services I did not receive. I’m very prone to self harm and it was hard for me to find help and be treated that way. 

I’m struggling mentally and emotionally and now having to deal with them not wanting to give me a refund because I didn’t do it at the right time. I was dealing with family emergencies. 

Why should I pay for services/medication I did not receive. Horrible experience.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"If this website helped you that’s nice.
For me it had a significantly negative impact on my mental health. My assigned counselor wasn’t very responsive or helpful in a personal manner. The sessions felt very cold and detached, it felt like they were reading from a script rather than interacting with a human being. I asked for a transfer but they gave me the runaround. 
The pricing is very misleading as well. After the first month they Jack up the prices so you go from 10 dollars to 80 dollars a month and they were not responsive when I asked for financial aid. This program doesn’t take most insurances.
I would not recommend. Added more stress and less aid. Made me more reserved to seek therapy.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

I rescheduled.  Then I got another message that my session was canceled again, and my therapist had left Cerebral.  There was only one other therapist available, but with no times that worked with my schedule.  I canceled the subscription, because it was a waste of my time and money.  I received confirmation that it was canceled.  Then a couple of weeks later I was charged $325.  What a joke.  I certainly expect a refund.

They call repeatedly, they text repeatedly, even though a month ago customer support told me that the subscription was cancelled. Now I have to cancel all over again. I’m done with it.

Set a new appointment with the new counselor, cancels and rescheduled twice within a few days. Tried contacting about changing the pharmacy for my prescription and never heard anything back.

After asking for a refund through support, representative completely ignored this request and gave generic copy/paste answers from their website about their plans and how to cancel.

1,Do not use this service!!! CHOOSE ANY OTHER HEALTH SERVICE!! They will make you pay fees out of nowhere and are overpriced. They gave me a two days notice before my appointment (while I was away for a family emergency- so I didn’t have WiFi) telling me I had to pay over 100 dollars. They didn’t text or call- just email. It forced me to choose between a huge fee or being medicated. So unprofessional and an egregious disregard for patient health. If I didn’t go to the appointment I would be without necessary medication and that’s not enough turn around to set up an appointment at a real psychiatrist. CHOOSE ANY OTHER SERVICE PROVIDER!!

They will prescribe you something one month, tell you for it to be refilled you have to see them monthly, and then the very next month tell you’re you’re out of luck because they can’t prescribe in California. Then they match you with someone new who you can’t meet with for weeks, only for it to repeat all over again. Seems like if you’re understaffed to service a particular state, then maybe just don’t.

1,"Don’t waste your time with this company. If you do make an attempt to use them they will definitely waste it for you.

After five attempts at signing up in the app consistently kicking me out and starting over, I had to use the website to finish my sign up. After signing up I was attached to a doctor in Texas while I’m in California. After waiting a week for my appointment the doctor informed me that she cannot help me because she’s not in my state. 

When I contacted customer service they attached me to a doctor in my state that did not have availability for a month and a half. When I reached out again to speak to customer service and asked for a refund on the fees for the first month since I would be receiving no service and I’ve had nothing but difficulties I was told that the best they can do is a 30% discount. 

For a company that is supposed to help with mental health care they, like so many others, don’t actually care and are only interested in your money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I wanted to love cerebral. It started off great. But it started getting fishy when I couldn’t make appointments until I had paid again. Which caused me to have long waits in between appointments. My care coordinator was changed 4 times in 5 months. The icing on the cake was when I was charged for medication, that was never sent. Which caused me to be without my meds for 3 days. They tried to fix it by sending it to my local pharmacy, but the provider wasn’t licensed in my state so they couldn’t fill it. I ended up having to call my regular doctor to get it filled. I feel bad for those that can’t do the same. Absolutely awful.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I have been using cerebral for several months now. I was prescribed medication through them. These medications have side effects if you stop using them imeadiatly. After months of using this service they call me the other day and say there is no more prescribers available and that I should look elsewhere for help. This was at the same time I was asking for a refill on my medication. So now I have to find a doctor that will prescribe me medication that cerebral put me on so I don’t have withdrawal symptoms. Not saying this could happen to everybody but it did happen to me and just want to make people aware that this is a possibility.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Don’t use this app if you are not financially stable, I had to cancel and mind you I have not use any of their services was too busy dealing with other things and they charge me 85 again when I cancel and wanted a refund they say they can’t issue it because of their policy… and billing cycle. If you are someone who is dealing with mental health that is not a good thing especially since not only do I deal with anxiety depression and suicidal thoughts but I’m also a type 1 diabetic my insulin is 156 dollars and now I can’t afford it. It may be my fault but they use the same old trick as any rotten company to keep your money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,The app said my membership would be $16 per week and did not have any availability to get me in for a month (charged me $135 during this time where I received no services). I finally got into my first appointment where the Doctor immediately told me I would need to reschedule because they didn’t not have a license in my state. I had to wait a week for my next appointment where they told me I score highly on ADHD but it would be better to go see a psychiatrist in person but also told me to keep my membership to “check in with them”. I was basically charged for over a month of services in which time I was not receiving any services.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Just like everyone else with the one star reviews- they talk to you and everything is great for the first month and then your meds aren’t refilled and surprise - no one can do anything about it.  Talk to your counselor - I did and her exact words were “let me see what I can do”. It’s Wellbutrin - not a controlled substance. You can’t start someone on a medicine for depression and then yank them off 30 days in around the holidays. 

My meds were supposed to be refilled Monday - I’m writing this six days later - after begging someone to respond via chat and email.  All they respond with is “here’s the suicide hotline”. 

Save your money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I signed up for an account.  Put my payment info in and was assigned a provider and given an appointment time.  I signed in for my first appointment only for the provider to be a no show.  When I checked my account information and plan to see what the protocol was for a no show provider and when I clicked on my plan it said that therapy was not available in my state.  I was not going to be told this and just billed the huge amount? Sorry.  That’s not right.  I was looking forward to finally getting some help in the most painless way possible in the comfort of my own home only to be disappointed and feeling scammed.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"The care team I had originally was really good. Then when I switched to my insurance they cut off my whole account and made me schedule a new session with a new prescriber to get a refill. The care team takes a long time to respond and you really are at their control. I’ve been completely out of my medicine for a week due to the complications and I can’t get a message back from anyone. They have a lot of organizational issues but once you find a good therapist and prescriber then it’s pretty okay. But if anything wrong happens, expect a bad experience.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I met with my prescriber and therapist with in a few days. After that it has been a nightmare. The app won’t let me sign up for new appointments. I can ask the provider to schedule me, if I can ever get an appointment. I have paid for 4 months and only seen the prescriber and therapist twice each. They did not provide a substitute prescriber when she was sick or had a family emergency. I had to wait two months to get into the second appointment with the therapist. I like the idea of this service but it is glitchy and the customer service employees I have reached out to keep saying that I agreed to this billing schedule so they can’t help me.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"How can this app be rated so high? All of the five star reviews are fake, they don’t even sound real. This is the biggest joke I’ve ever wasted my
Time on. Took 3 weeks to even get an appt, the nurse practitioner was rude and condescending at times, other times very understanding. She prescribed meds which I was excited about but I don’t know when they are coming, when I will be charged, if they are generic or band name, and no one is answering my questions. The chat function take several days to respond. I can’t get a straight answer what I will be charged next month, as the chat person says one thing but the account info says another.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Don’t waste your money, time, and mental health on this company. For a company literally centered in the space to help people, it is unbelievable that they flat out refuse to fix a bug that makes the app, that I pay $100 a month for, unusable. I am not able to schedule any appointments as I should be able to int the app. I continue to get rude responses from someone who only offers to “schedule for me” but will not get the issue fixed or escalate the issue to anyone higher up. The doctor I have is unbelievably incredible but unfortunately this service is completely ridiculous.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"i have been paying 85$ a month for no reason. there’s never appointments available, no one ever messages me back and i am losing it. DO NOT waste your money. i really was hopeful for this app but it would be easier and cheaper to go in person… very upset and disappointed. i can’t even get an email or message back about a refund either. my medication that was prescribed is giving me awful side effects, but if i quit taking them and don’t ween off i have seizures and i am lost. i don’t have insurance at the moment so this was my only option. my mental health has never been so bad.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I have been double charged numerous times. And I’ve even sent statements and screenshots of the charges as proof and have been called a liar. I have been reassigned to 4 different therapists because they keep quitting cerebral and honestly nothing is more annoying then feeling like I have to re-explain my trauma over and over again. Only for them to constantly not have appointments for the new therapist they give me. They don’t accept my insurance so they keep taking money from me. Not any big insurance company but a college student earning min wage. Hate this app and would never recommend it to anyone.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Be aware this company has questionable business practices that are not geared toward customer health or wellbeing. Despite the number of positive reviews Cerebral has received, note that the negative reviews are consistently about serious billing practices: paying for services not rendered.

The positive reviews are largely about the therapist services. Most of the complaints are from people who were never even able to get to that part. It seems to be a gamble to get started with Cerebral: maybe you’ll find support and service, or maybe you’ll be burdened with a financial nightmare on top of what you’re already going through.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Honestly I have tried a lot of online therapy platforms before, but Cerebral has been the worst. 
YOU CANNOT CONTROL YOUR OWN CANCELLATION TO THEIR SUBSCRIPTION.
Also, they’ll allow you to pay for and sign up for services that “aren’t available in your area”. I spent $100 for medication and therapy sessions. When I went to do my therapy session I couldn’t complete it without headphones that had a mic, which I didn’t have.
I waited over a month for my medication appointment and a week before my provider quit. Instead of prioritizing me or having that providers caseload covered, I was forced to book another appointment. Two months out. 
Then when I asked for a refund and to be refunded, I was sent to a service email. I needed to fill out a form, great. I do this and the next two days receive the same exact email from the service mail address.
I finally had to cancel my card and get a new one. Absolute extortion. -5/10.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"It is such a shame that this platform wasn’t executed better. I had a horrifically unfriendly and unpleasant first meeting with a psychiatrist, which was followed by a care team member who also couldn’t seem less bored by their job. The platform is misleading in the sign up process, it is $85 dollars per month without medication costs - so don’t believe it is anything else. Providers and care team take hours if not days to reply. I feel like I’m stuck with it because I don’t currently have insurance and need medication, but I look forward to not paying $85 per month for basically getting refills.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was with cerebral for several months and they never once billed the insurance they claimed to accept. Instead, they took the non-insured copay which is much higher and pocketed it.

Their customer service and billing is specifically set up so that you can never get them to take insurance. It’s like their agents don’t even speak the same language. I am a very good commutator and I was on the phone with them for hours trying before I saw this for what it is.

It’s a scam preying on mentally ill people, counting on them giving up or not noticing that they’re taking inordinate amounts of cash for little to no care.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I got cerebral because I just started a new job and they gave me a hard time for needing to meet with my doctor. I supposed I chose the wrong plan and 375$ was taken from my account. Since then I have been trying to cancel my account , but no one from the “cancel my membership” team has contacted me. I have emailed support and called. During this process I was charged 375$ again. And it came right when my rent was due. I am living in my car right now because of this whole mess. Still can’t get a response from anyone. For a mental health app they care very little about my current struggles.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’d vote not stars if possible, I was charged almost $200 in total and received zero treatment. These people made sure to get my money before deciding NOT to treat me after answering a VERY CONFUSING QUESTIONNAIRE and asked me to go through my provider anyway… WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY, glad I’m well enough mentally where I can explore other options but this app actually had the audacity to charge me so much money and have not done ONE SINGLE THING FOR ME. Good luck if they don’t accept your health insurance AND IF YOUR PARENTS HAVE CERTAIN PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS….also when I called to speak to someone about canceling I still had to fill out a form and official REQUEST A REFUND VIA EMAIL… RIDICULOUS",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This app does the bare minimum to provide services. If you are in dire need of mental health services and know it, do not use this cheap method as a way to save money. The workers are all people who are using this app as a second source of income, and say to consistently update them but they never respond. Update: Cerebral is now charging me $85 monthly for my deactivated account… I get a message stating my account is deactivated if I attempt to log into Cerebral and have an email from Cerebral stating account closure, but Cerebral is still continuing to charge. Nightmare company for people with mental health issues",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"It’s everything it says it is: it allows you to connect with a counselor and prescriber who are certified to help you. For the most part though, you’ll be waiting 2 weeks or more for an appointment.

In the event that the service becomes too expensive and you wish to cancel though - it’s a nightmare. For 2 consecutive months I tried to cancel my membership with both months charging me anyway.  This is because the only way to cancel is through an email that must then be reviewed. I’m guessing nobody bothered to review mine the first time.

So I was charged twice for a service I didn’t use because I was trying to cancel, and for this they refunded me a whole $20 for just taking my money without providing me a service. Thanks Cerebral...

So yeah - make sure you’re prepared to use this service religiously to get your money’s worth.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Literally a scam taking advantage of individuals who truly need help. 

I only had the app for a few hours on Friday and requested to cancel right away since there was a 3-5 week wait to see a prescriber and counselor.
Then a prescriber called me without an appointment and immediately just wanted to start me on medication without proper diagnostic procedures and tests. I ignored it since I had an email stating my cancellation was in process and would take 2 business days.

I received a cancellation CONFIRMATION Tuesday evening.
Then only two hours later I received another email requesting payment for a prescription and then right after that a email stating payment received? 
1) why was this even requested if my membership was canceled?
2) why was a payment authorized when I did not click “pay now”?

I’m calling my credit card company and disputing their ridiculous scam tactics for a full refund and reporting this company to the BBB.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I will write a 100 reviews if I have to if it means it’ll save someone from getting scammed and losing money like i did. Horrible customer service. Literally the worst I’ve ever received. If you need a refund you won’t get one. All the people apart of this company act incompetent and talk in circles around your questions. ALSO IF YOU DONT HAVE INSURANCE. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not let these people take your money. The price is not worth the horrible “help” you will receive. They prescribe you very serious medications after only talking to you for 30 minutes. This service is dangerous. Get help from literally anywhere else if you can.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,The company is organized very poorly. I met with my prescriber 2 weeks ago and was told my medication would be sent in the mail however when it didnt come and there was no shipment tracker after a few days i asked what the issue was and the only response was from someone not even on my care team saying they messaged my prescriber asking what the issue was… i did that every day going forward and got the same response from a different person every day and there has still been no response from my prescriber or anyone telling me what exactly the issue is.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Was prescribed my normal medication and I also signed up for therapy. After two therapy sessions, I met with my prescriber again. They told me, based on something *private* I shared with my therapist, that I was disqualified from receiving my normal medication. Glad these two months are over. Also it is near impossible to cancel. Do not use this service if you have ADHD and want to be treated with respect.

Edit: still in cancellation process. They waited until one day before renewal to send me a form I am required to fill out *over email* in order to cancel. The form requires 1-2 days to process. What a joke!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"It might work for you, but my experience was disappointing. My first prescriber no-showed to my appointment. I was then told that I was going to be re-assigned to another prescriber so I made an appointment with her and she was nearly 20 minutes late to my appointment. My appointment was supposed to be only 30 minutes so I had already decided to cancel. Since my 30 minutes was almost over and I hadn’t received a call, this left me with very little confidence in their services. The care might be good if they actually keep their appointments and call clients on time. I felt like my time and money were wasted.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I decided to try the therapy appointments as my VA counselor recently moved. 

The only appointments that were available were late evening, which required some coordination due to family obligations. For our first meeting the counselor was not present and I had to rebook the appointment. While not thrilled, I understand these things happen on occasion.

The next day, the care coordinator was helpful in getting it rescheduled. I even received an email confirmation for the new date and time. 

For our second attempt, there was no link to join the meeting within my appointments tab. Naturally, so late in the evening support was closed for the rest of the day.

I’ve heard good things about Cerebral from friends, but this much effort to simply have others be unaccountable is NOT worth the service. I’m going to downgrade my plan and have reached out to support via email.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Do not use this company. They would constantly cancel my appointments multiple times in a row and then still charge me, then when I would call to complain/question why I’m still being charged when they cancel my appointments constantly, and all they said was they can offer me 15% off the next month... The therapy was OK at first and then it deteriorated significantly after being a patient for a few months.

1,"I started off liking this app, even though it’s a tad more expensive then others if they don’t take your insurance. I had a great provider and stuff at the beginning, then all of a sudden the provider quit and I was left for a month unable to access medication waiting for a new provider. This is not uncommon because it just happened to my girlfriend as well the day before her appointment. They are unable to reschedule us for a month. Abrupt stops to medication is not great and has side affects and then can’t wait to go through the process of starting them again. Thanks cerebral.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"At first, everything went smoothly. I got an appointment quickly and got my medication but my refills were late and I was without medication for some time. After the lengthy process of trying to get somebody to respond to switch to picking up from my pharmacy I thought I was in the clear. 

Then there were no refills from the pharmacy and I was out medication again for 3 days which isn’t acceptable especially for the medication I’m on. 

And now they have canceled my appointment after waiting weeks for it. I would take your business elsewhere as I’m about to.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"For a mental health/care app and business, the process of leaving them is nearly akin to abuse. You try to leave, they won’t let you do it easy. In fact, I’m still attempting to stop being charged for a service that I only attempted to use and found out that they did not offer what I needed. 

I have followed the steps that have been listed and have got nowhere. 

I called and was placed on hold, which they claimed was a queue. After about 15 minutes, I was given an automated message and asked to leave a detailed message. It gave me enough time to state my name before it hung up on me. 

This is ridiculous. Please just let me leave and cancel this. I can not afford 85/month in charges and even more so since I’m not using it. 

I cannot, for the life of me, recommend this app to anyone and I’m even starting to wonder if the reviews are being faked to lure in OBVIOUS vulnerable people.

Horrible customer service and complete rip off.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,i downloaded this app and made an account but after seeing it was 85$ a month i deleted it because i couldn’t afford that. Somehow they got my card info and charged me anyways! I reached out to my bank and they told me i had to contact them. I ignored the one transaction and just hoped it wouldn’t charge me again. A month later and they take out 85$ again when i hadn’t used the app for more then 10 minutes. I emailed them about it and haven’t gotten a response and this was several days ago.

It’s 85 bucks a month just to get refills, not worth even half that due to the overall not having it together that seems to permeate the company.

1,"The “prescriber” promised she would send my medication to my local pharmacy that uses GoodRx for lower prescription prices. That route would’ve cost me $30 which was worth it.

Towards the end of the month I was looking at plans and considering upgrading, a pop up window gave me an offer of 70% off ($99 cost) to upgrade for 30 days. I took the deal and was charged $240, then the app showed I would be charged $325, the full price, two days later. I contacted customer service, (24 hour ordeal) they refunded the $240 and said I still needed to pay the $325 the next day.

1,"I wish I would have listens to the reviews.
Cerebral takes advantage of their customers having mental and emotional problems to further bully them into despair.

I start a discounted trial in early December, they did not have providers available until January. I am patient no problem. I scheduled my appointments for January YET IVE BEEN CHARGED FOR THE SERVICE SINCE DEC.

I tried one session, the therapist was great, she listened and provided medicine. I have insurance but they still wanted $150 plus $85 a month so I decided to cancel this and go to my regular therapist. Because I can not afford to not be depressed under Cerebral.

I’ve been charged for every months since then, my credit company has been wonderful at helping me with their abusive charges yet they charge my card again despite loosing the dispute.

1,"You can’t choose your own appointment date and times.  The only option they give you is take the first available date and time.  When I contacted support so I could get access to the calendar function on the app to schedule my own appointment, they took it upon themselves to just schedule me for an appointment without my permission and did not fix the calendar access on the app.  Not at all convenient with my busy schedule and extremely rude to assume I’d want the first available instead of being able to schedule the appointment myself on the app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I thought it was going to be convenient….. I had one video call and got charged $70 for them to say.. we are not able to help you at this time…. To cancel you have to email them what kind of service is that. They should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of people who are seeking mental health support. This was truly a waste of time and money. To whatever apology the company gives me I hope they shove it where the sun don’t shine.

1,Complete waste of money. It’s nearly impossible to get an appointment and their ”support” closes tickets without doing anything to help you at all. Overpriced and basically worthless. They scammed me out of the first month because there were no appointments available until they charged me again for the second month. They refused to refund the cost I paid for the first month and I had to email an address that is difficult to find and jump through a bunch of hoops just to cancel the subscription. This is not a service to help you. They just want your money.,cerebral-mental-health,,,

As I was doing the onboarding process, I answered the question about family heart condition history, as my dad just passed from  a sudden heart attack. I was then told AFTER I ALREADY PAID that this made me ineligible for remote care. I understand why, but I wish I knew this before spending any money",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The app is constantly changing my doctors and cancelling appointments with no notifications.

2,"I am rating Cerebral 2 stars and not 1 because I don’t know how good the actual service is. 

I decided to try it, but as I was in the middle of filling out the questionnaire, it asked me if anyone in my immediate family has a heart condition, and when I said yes, it said I should not use their services. I was told this after I had already paid. Essentially, I lost 30 dollars to get told to go somewhere else.

This question should be asked before our accounts are charged. I am writing this review so that someone else in my shoes does not also waste their money.

I then had to complete the questionnaire and schedule appointments just so that I could delete my account so I wouldn’t get charged for another month.

I realize now, it’s just about the money for them. I get prescribed medications I didn’t ask for and the prescribers change constantly. The turnover rate is high. It’s impossible to get appointments with decent therapists.

1,"i don’t leave bad reviews, but i think i had a particularly bad time with cerebral. for starters, i was paying $140 a month (later changed plan to $80) for 1 half hour call with a therapist. during first call, my provider was not friendly which i took particularly hard as i was telling her my plans on ending my life. when we ended the call she said “don’t do anything stupid” i thought she was joking but she was dead serious by her facial expression. to ensure safety she scheduled a follow up meeting with me for 15 minutes but never showed up. the new prescriber i was given didn’t have any openings for several months. the original therapist i had left cerebral after first call, and while my new one was very kind, i didn’t like that she answered the call high as a kite on weed and basically said to me that it seemed like i was doing good and that i should stay positive. wouldn’t recommend at all.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

No question is acceptable to anyone, the app tells you to call, and if you call the recording prompts you to the app. None of the functionality works, the reschedule is 100% bugged. It’s just all so terrible. I thought I had made a big stride for my mental health, and Cerebral has just made me even more anxious to possibly have to go through this whole circus again.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"You have to pay upfront even if you only find out later through customer support that they aren’t in network with your insurance. Then they’ll charge you again after you cancel your subscription if you aren’t careful. Luckily they changed their refund policy and gave me my money back, which I am thankful for. Try it and maybe you’ll be luckier than me. I know it varies by state what services you can have. Check state laws as well for what medications can be prescribed over virtual services.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"after a month and change of using this app, it’s garbage. Waste of money. Ran out of meds for weeks on end waiting to hear back from someone about sending my refill to the pharmacy, was treated like I was stupid every step of the way, and it is IMPOSSIBLE to speak to an actual human over the phone regarding medications. You’ll just be told to contact through the apps messages at every single automated option. When you do finally get put on hold to speak to someone, you’ll just sit on hold for hours. By far the worst mental health app you can waste money on.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"If I could give this zero, I would. For an app that supposedly cares about mental health they certainly add an unnecessary amount of stress!! 

If this app/website doesn’t take your insurance the first time, run and run far away as fast as you can. I have now been charged $259 three months in a row despite claims they’d manually invoice me for the advertised $29/month. 

Every time you reach out to someone from support you get a different person explaining how to clear browser history or try a different browser like I’ve never used a laptop before. SMH. One interaction was outright rude, told me I would not get a refund and to cancel my subscription immediately.. what? They won’t input insurance info for you but won’t fix the platform that fails to upload it every time ? Get it together. 

I’m still in the midst of resolving reimbursement issues. Will not be recommending this service to anyone.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They don’t work with any of the most common insurance so expect to be paying out of pocket. The care provided is impersonal and very cookie-cutter generic sessions. Once I canceled, they kept my money for that month and refused any more care appointments and did not send my medication. All of which I had payed for. After contacting support for a refund they told me that they cannot provide any kind of refund due to them billing as a subscription service. Also read the news on how they like to over prescribe medication and offer the wrong medication at that. This service is a scam.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"If I could rate this company/app no starts I would.
Decided to give this app a try signing up verification and subscription was 30$.
Never once attended a appointment for a doctor of medicine I was seeking.
Monthly subscription fee was a whopping 85$.
Decided to cancel because I didn’t use the app once for its services.
Asked for a refund through Via email with customer support.
I’m told no refunds are issued after monthly date billed for.
Keep in mind I never attended one appointment nor used this service for any medication.
Absolutely scam.
How can you purchase a service.
Not use the service. Want a refund/return.
Just like buying a item in the store you didn’t open and having certain amount of days to refund and bring it back.
This is not the case with this company they take your money and don’t care.
I will be reporting to BBB. And Apple app support.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,A lot of the stuff they don’t give explanation to of how it works.. I’ve been talking with them for weeks to try to get a refund because they don’t explain anything to you until you pay and once I told them that this is not what I thought it was everything that they made me pay for afterwards and they literally ignored everything that I’ve ever said if it has the word refund in it so now I’m trying to go through the process of trying to get them to give me my month of counseling that I paid for since they don’t wanna give me a refund,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I have major depression and ptsd and they honestly made me more depressed with their customer service. My insurance no longer pays to help me with cerebral so I cannot afford it. I was trying to cancel and instead my plan got “upgraded” to the exact plan. I had the medication and counseling which changed to medication and counseling?? Best part is I got charged $56 dollars for an “upgrade” of a service I was trying to cancel. The customer service was rude and did not want to refund me. They settled for $16 🤦🏻‍♀️ Absolute scammers and they do the opposite of helping those with mental issues. Do not use them please!!!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The service was a little confusing to use but that’s not the problem, the problem is I got the service then realized it was too expensive so I cancelled it right away (also it’s unreasonably difficult to cancel) and that was about a month ago and I just got billed again by them!! I am trying to cancel again but I’m worried it will end up just like last time since I followed everything they said I had to do to cancel it and obviously it didn’t work. I’m so upset I cancelled because I couldn’t afford it and here I am still paying for it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They make you pay before you get to see what the app is like. I couldn’t get an appointment to see a counselor for 6 weeks. So I paid for an entire month without being able to speak to a counselor and I’m canceling because I thought this was going to be more efficient in getting me help. I also couldn’t see when the appointments were until I signed up so I had already paid the money before I saw I wasn’t getting helped any time soon :( so disappointed and sad I wasted my time and money. Don’t make the same mistake I did, this app is crap.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"First thing, I created an account with Cerebral a few months ago. Had been getting almost daily promotion emails about discounts as low as less than $50 a month. It makes me wonder if they focus more on pricing schemes than care quality. I’d rather spend a little more to get better care. 

Second thing, the app doesn’t work. Where are the engineers? I forgot my password recently and tried to reset my passwords 2 or 3 times. It won’t go through.  And there was no error message, just stuck. Very bad UX. I’m disappointed.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"If you have literally never seen a therapist or psychiatrist this may be a good place to start, but that’s the best I can say at this point. The therapists you’re assigned to are not licensed. You get to choose who you want to see based on a photo and their biography. But at the end of the day, they’re going through materials provided by Cerebral that they can read to you and then send you. For basic anxiety and depression work, it may be fine. For deep work or overcoming trauma, look elsewhere.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up for a trial, it was fine but not really for me. My billing date was May 19th, they require you to cancel at least 24th a prior and on May 17th I submitted my cancellation request. They sent me a survey as to why which I completed immediately. On the 19th they still charged me $85 even though I followed their cancellation rules and I reached out again and they have basically ignored me. They are thieves do not use their product or services, they claim to help and instead take advantage of people going through difficult times.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"To put mental health help behind a paywall is upsetting. I work a full time job and I still wouldn’t be able to pay $85 a month just to get prescribed some pills. And the fact that I was supposed to put in my insurance AFTER paying is just ridiculous. This app doesn’t feel like it’s helping people. It’s a rouse to get people to pay buckets for something that is clearly buggy, unresponsive and overall unhelpful. I’m glad I didn’t waste any of my money and read the reviews first. Save yourself the headache and find a real therapist who can actually help you.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,They have affordable options for medication management and therapy however it is a case of “you get what you pay for.” The therapist I had must of been fresh out of school and clearly had no idea what she was doing. I was really concerned with some of the “advice” she gave. The medication management is subpar also. Getting info from the provider it only possible if you set an appointment. Going through the chat is like pulling teeth to get any accomplished or info. I would recommend spending a bit more for something more professional.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Just a blank white page after I enter my credentials and log in. Tried the typical troubleshooting routine and made sure iOS and the app are updated. I emailed customer service and messaged my “care team” via the desktop website, and they have either not responded after a number of days, or the person was seemingly even less qualified to answer my own question than I am. 

This service has a ton of promise. Absolutely incredible in concept. Not translating to real-life performance though.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I thought this was gonna be of great use. Unfortunately my counselor repeatedly canceled sessions(after only seeing her once) and it was near impossible to reschedule because her schedule was always full for the month by the time she cancelled, which meant I couldn’t see anyone for the month I PAID FOR. So I requested a refund because..what’s the point of paying $80+meds and not even see a counselor? Basically giving them money for nothing. And then they didn’t want to refund me at first. After going back and forth I only got a partial refund. Felt like I was scammed.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"BE WEARY IF YOU HAVE FAMILY HISTORY OF HEART DISEASE!

Went through the entire process and was relieved that my insurance was approved. Was charged the $30 to sign up after a lengthy questionnaire process. Only after I was charged do they ask questions that can disqualify you from getting online-based care. Terrible order of operations. This company should absolutely know better that people are coming for mental health care, can get their hopes up when their process is approved, and then be given horrible news immediately after great news.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Tried to cancel, didn’t hear back, they billed me again anyways over a week later, for the upcoming month I don’t plan to use.  That unexpected charge just complicated my finances and now I’m spending my day worrying about charges and cancellations instead of the things I need to.

This is like canceling a gym membership, and adding unneeded stress to my mental state.  No excuse for this, you can cancel anything else with a simple touch of a button.  This is designed to be slow and difficult so they can continue to bill you for money, like they are with me now.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,This is all about hoping you subscribe and forget about it. The monthly fee seems reasonable until you are a few months in and realize nothing really has happened as expected and definitely expect the funding from your account to happen flawlessly each month regardless of whether they or you reschedule or they have the prescribers who quit etc that cause you delays. Would not recommend despite other reviews.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"After being prescribed my medication, it was never actually sent to my pharmacy. When i reached out to get it resent they told me i had to wait till i met with my prescriber again for a refill. After stating i never received my original prescription, they let me know they would work on it. Here i am today, still no update or prescription. I think this is a scam to get you on a monthly subscription so they can get you hooked by relying on your medication. On top of that my prescriber was very insensitive. Would not recommend or waste your money",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Go to trust pilot and read the 1 star reviews. This company should not be allowed to continue operating... ESPECIALLY since they are all about “improving mental health”. My stress and anxiety sky rocketed just by being involved with them. Save yourself some rage and DO NOT USE CEREBRAL. I’m begging you!

Edit: Thank you Stephanie for the automated response to my plea for people to stay away from Cerebral. I’ve read this same copy/pasted response on every 1 star review and I’m wondering if you reading all these horror stories is making you second guess why you are spending your energy working for a scam company?",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I signed up for cerebral under the false impression it was $7 and that they accepted my insurance. After paying I was then told that they do not accept my insurance and I was charged $30. Their online customer service is not helpful at all and your emails are redirected to several other employees who tell you they will get back to you in the next few days. I never met with any of their healthcare professionals and tried to cancel an hour after signing up. They refused to give me a refund. I am very unhappy with how unprofessional they are.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I gave my full medical history when I joined Cerebral and even discussed it again when the Nurse was prescribing me medication. I asked “will this have an adverse reaction. I’m taking Flecainide”. She said not to worry. So I took it and ended up with SVTs

Additionally, I was never reimburse for a “n acount that was never fully set up for my son. He never even got through registration and they still charged 2 months. I had to tell my bank to close my card so the would keep charging me because they stopped replying to my requests to resolve the issue of the unregistered un used account. 

This company is dangerous and hot garbage. If you want help immediately go to urgent care. All they do is prescribe medicine here and then try to get you to upgrade a couple hundred bucks to talk to a therapist for 30 minutes. Why is this not the other way around.

It’s poor business practice.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Paid the $30 for the first month and had the meeting with prescriber. They then decide that they can’t prescribe me. I get that it’s more difficult to get controlled substances, I get that, but don’t give vulnerable people hope that they can get help take their money and then not help them. I was ready to be able to live my life again and be able to function properly but instead I have $30 gone that I can’t get back. I don’t normally post bad reviews but my life is terrible right now and I just needed help that I thought I could get here.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,If I could give 0 stars I would. I purchased a plan and canceled less than a day after because of the options I was given for an available therapist. The options were either an associate/intern that is under supervision and accumulating hours to get licensed or a social worker that is not a licensed therapist. If I’m working on my mental health I want to work on it with an experienced licensed therapist and more so if I’m paying almost $200 for a plan. This company refuses to give me my money back for a service I did not even use because of their “policies”… I feel scammed.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"So initially I thought this service was good. It help with me not having issues, but I sent a email to cancel my service and 3 days later they took money out my account and I asked for them to refund it. They refused! Saying it’s in their policy. I was forced to pay for services I have not received or used. I’m surprised being this is a application that helps people going through tough times yet they want to make it even harder apparently. How do you turn a organization like this over to BBB? Super disappointed. Will not recommend to anyone!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I wanted so badly for this service to work, and I tried for months. I was assigned a new care provider every single month and had to walk constantly walk them through my history. Changing medications was a NIGHTMARE. My Care Coordinator regularly confused my account with other people on the platform, sending me potentially confidential information meant for someone else. They kept charging me and sending medication well over a month after I CONFIRMED my account was canceled and trying to get ahold of support staff was impossible. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I communicated that I no longer wanted to participate in this program due to the payments. The company said we will give you a discount if you stay! So I said sure that payment is more in my range. But low and behold 2 weeks later the payment arrangement was out of the window my account was charged and now no one is returning any of my emails. A complete scam. They said my insurance wasn’t covering my sessions but they had my insurance information for over a month. Why wasn’t that discovered when they were running it for me to sign up? Complete scam artist,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I spent a month and a half trying to verify my ID, I reached out twice and both times I was told it was already verified but I was never able to move past that step. In the meantime they kept charging me so I paid $110 for a service I was never able to use. Don’t even bother asking for a refund, they won’t say no, they’ll just keep dancing around the issue until you give up. I’m sure the actual service is not bad just good luck actually being able to use it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They made you pay upfront before signing up, so after they took my money they tell me my IDs are not valid (Not UK or US) and they tell you only after you paid they don’t work with stimulants.

An absolute scam, I’ll definitely be reaching out to my credit company to get my money back, given that I was not provided with any service, not even finished the onboarding 

This is horrible taking in account this is for people with ADHD that feel overwhelmed and don’t have the focus or energy (at least for me) to do the reaserch and paperwork for a reimbursement",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I decided to try this in October. Set up appointments and account during initial visit to the site. The next day I tried to log back in and it says my email was never used to create an account. But somehow they still charged me the $30 special fee. Thankfully I used a disposable card because to this day they are still trying to charge me for a service I could never use. Had I not used a disposable card I would be down $85/month with no way to cancel it through them. Which would have been quite taxing on my mental health,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"My clinician never showed up for our appointment, and so after the support staff told me they would schedule an appointment with the same clinician the following week, sure enough on the day I was supposed to have my appointment the clinician showed up to the online video chat… only to disappear within 3 mins of me signing into the same video chat. The support staff then told us that the clinician was “no longer seeing patients”. Completely unprofessional and very scammy got our refund only after chewing out the support staff. Buyer please beware.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’ve been using Cerebral for over a year and for the last couple months I haven’t been able to use my app, every time it loads or tries to load it shuts down. I’ve uninstalled it and installed it, I’ve shut down my phone and turned it back on. Nothing is working. So I tried it on my friends phone, downloaded it onto her phone and did the same stuff. Your IT department needs to work on this app because it’s annoying me that I can’t talk to my team. The one star is only for the technical part of the app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This is a joke unless you’re just trying to get some cheap antidepressants. The “provider” didn’t listen to a word I said. She insisted on diagnosing me with depression and tried to convince me that a drug which has side affects such as depression and suicidal thoughts was a good solution. Half of my answers to her robotic questions involved me talking about my job and where I work and then all of a sudden she asked me if I worked. The chat feature on the main page is useless as they don’t answer your actual questions. It’s a bunch of bots posing as doctors. Zero stars.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"First of all the lady I had an appointment with was amazing and super sweet and knowledgeable.
However!! 
I needed to request to cancel this service was not aware of the window of cancellation and they are refusing to refund me even though I submitted a cancellation before I was charged so here I am out of almost 100 dollars for a service I am not using! Save your money and go somewhere else 
Been back and forth with customer service and they are trying to give me 30% off their services I cannot 💀 
Worst company ever",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up for the service but could not connect with a intake person so I gave up. Did not know the account would be billed regardless of not receiving any services from them.I’ve tried to call the number and nobody answers also sent several emails with no response. I reached a person through the message portal who suggested I deactivate my account. This is terrible customer service I can’t believe you would bill someone when you never did anything. 
I’ve asked for a refund several times with no response.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I paid for the subscription and set up my appointment and my doctor never showed. Not only that, but their feedback team simply told me to reschedule. They gave no indication of refunding me any money and on top of it, this service is difficult to cancel. It’s a reoccurring monthly fee, I emailed to have it canceled (no cancel button, this is the only way to do it) and they are super slow and up helpful in their responses. If you are looking for mental health do not pick this app. you will end up not even seeing a healthcare professional and paying monthly fees anyway.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Thieves, truly. We began the service because my husband had no health insurance. I paid for therapy and med management. There was one therapist to pick from, and she was never available. They charged me regardless. I asked to switch plans and be refunded for the therapy he did not receive. They ghosted me. He switched to meds only, they refused to refund the money from therapy. When I complained, they locked him out of his account and involuntarily cancelled his service. They then continued to charge me. They won’t help over the phone or through email. I am going to the police.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They start of charging you cheap and then before you know it they take out $200 without a warning. They even argued I never got charged $200 even after I sent them the statement. 

I recommend just using or going to someone else. You pay $200/month for a 20 minute call discussing any side effects with the medicine and that’s it. They just throw pills at you and pray you don’t overdose. 

I strongly recommend not using this and just go seek actual help. This has really messed me up. I’m on pills I later found out I should have never been on.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This low quality mental health service is harmful. They have people who lack basic communication, listening, and emotional intelligence skills prescribing medication. At the end of my first session I felt almost violated. I literally would have been better off if I had skipped over this “service” altogether. Thank God I didn’t start medication with these people. Read the other reviews. They delete negative comments on their social media pages. 

Just do your research and spend the money on higher quality care. No one deserves to go through this.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Stick with a local solution because the service stinks, it really doesn’t work. It takes forever to see someone snd even longer to get prescriptions filled. They have absolutely no customer service. Everything is done at their pace through email or a chat portal that seems to be reviewed once a day. If you don’t advocate for yourself aggressively you will get no results. Do not recommend. Again, I’d explore a local solution because this is not convenient at all. Their marketing is unfair and deceptive.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Had to miss an appointment with the person responsible for getting my prescriptions because of a family emergency. Proceed to be ignored by the company for over a month and had to go through withdrawals and get myself off the drug. Granted I’m no longer feeling depressed like I used to and I’m no longer on my medication, but still NEVER USE THIS COMPANY. Go see a real in person therapist or at the very least use better health in addition to your actual primary care physician for medications. At least those people won’t ignore you.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"This service uses Entry level professionals and makes it VERY DIFFICULT TO CANCEL. They will keep billing you despite cancellation requests and no further appointments. Their app erases information on your history so you must use email to communicate with them. I filed FRAUD on their recurring charges because they refused to credit the full amount from when my cancellation was requested to when they actually stopped billing. BEWARE. After 3 months meeting with a counselor weekly, I was going in circles and not making progress.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Imagine having a medical issue and needing to call your utility company for customer service. Prescribers come and go. The ones you are left with cancel meetings at will and day of. Patients therefore missing refills on their medications because of this and customer support tells you to wait for your next appointment to discuss. Problems being an appointment can never be made. I am now  unsafely off medication for 5 days with no one willing to assist. There are other similar companies out there for this.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The prescribers and care counselors cancel appointments with little to no notice, the prescribers don’t authorize refills (even for non-narcotics) and leave you hanging when it is time for a refill because the script is only for 30 days and they only see you every 90 days.  

I suspect the problems lie with the way the prescribers are employed or paid, because it is impossible to get a hold of them and on the same page with you.  

Save your money and try another service, Cerebral isn’t going to work with you or for you.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I am extremely depressed and suicidal.  
After seeing this application add, I decided to go for it and pay monthly.  
 
🚩It took me a month to have an appointment with the therapist, for about 44 minutes. 
• The provider cancelled my first appointment 
• Unable to speak to a therapist more than once a month ( Which doesn’t help AT ALL ).
• Was prescribed medication over three weeks ago, never received it. When I contacted them they responded that their was an issue with my insurance ( definitely not ) 
• Asked them about my medication and they responded saying ; you will receive them when the issue is revolve. So how many more weeks will I wait for this? 
• My next appointment with the therapist is in 5 weeks  
 
I will now contact my bank to get a refund, this application is not only scandalous but fraudulent. 
 
THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU, OR YOUR HEALTH!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I contacted them during an emergency and was ignored for 3+ days. I waited 3 weeks for a therapy session and the website was broken, she was lagging like crazy, was incredibly unprofessional. You can’t cancel in the account you have to submit a form. I was really sick and didn’t submit it before the charge came out of my account. They charged me $375 this month after I begged them to refund me- I wasn’t going to be using the service further. It’s so messed up. They made my mental illness soooo much worse this past month.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Trying to find an appointment is horrible. Find a time, get a notification you need to reschedule, then no availability. Follow-up with care coordinator, suddenly lots of availability (weird but I’ll manage).
I need a follow-up with practitioner - no availability at all! If you want a different practitioner you can’t just pick, you need to wait a day or two for the care coordinator to give you the bios and wait more time to pick. 
You don’t get any notifications that your provider is not available… forever!!!! It’s like they don’t care!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Decided to give it a try as I’ve been on various medications for the past 10 years. After discussing my current meds, which are not working, the Doc decided that I should stay what I’m on, even though the reason I am trying cerebral is to find a better treatment plan.

Also found out that trying to cancel is painful. Cannot do it over the phone, only via email.

To me it seems like just getting you to use their preferred meds is their true goal, any benefit to the patient is 2nd.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up on Dec 1st and can’t get an appointment until Jan 13, which is after the next billing cycle. I paid for a month and got nothing and they won’t refund even though I canceled and received no service. If you want a prescription appointment you can get that in a week or two, but if you actually are looking for a counseling/therapy appointment you have to wait over a month. They are clearly short on staff and I don’t know why they are advertising as if they actually have availability.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"These guys made away with my 15$ first month, only then telling me that I wouldn’t get a prescriber for over 1 month. So then I’d just be paying 15$ to wait?? Also I should be able to see that before I sign up. Then instead of giving me a refund for being misleading, these cheap fillintheblanks decided to give me just a partial refund, so they could make out with 10$ for free. Really have to strongly recommend you look elsewhere for treatment, yes your first intuition is right, it’s too good to be true.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I, like others here, started the Cerebral process and believed I was finally receiving the care I deserved.  Wrong!  
My provider disappeared, my prescription disappeared with her and the full blown panic attack this caused was ignored by Cerebral.  
Cerebral did offer another provider for me, her first available appointment is in 4 weeks.  4 weeks of payments to them while I suffer the anxiety and danger of medication withdrawal.  
Note that my situation involved no insurance or payment problems. I was happy to pay their price for the service as long as it was received.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Scheduling is a pain. Availability for appointments is absurdly limited. You get a provider and a counselor. Signed up to get treatment for the ADHD I’ve already been diagnosed with. Provider gave me an anti-depressant and told me I should sleep more. Thanks 🙄. Counselor was very kind, but basically told me it sounded like my life was in order. Oh, and then finally mentioned that they don’t prescribe any medication for ADHD. Took several months after I cancelled to finally get them to stop charging me and sending me pills I explicitly said I didn’t want. BIG YIKES.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The nurse practitioners are worthless and can’t even get you the right medications prescribed to you. I told them my history with SSRI’s and how they caused me suicidal ideations in the past, but ended up writing me a script for Prozac…. Uhhh what?!?! Do you want me to end up in a psych hospital? Also, you get 30 minutes with a ‘care counselor’… this person spent the entire time boasting about themselves and how great their methods are to me for nearly the entire time, total narcissist, caused me extreme anxiety. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone, total waste of time.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

Thanks 🙄 Customer support was unhelpful, and I never heard back from my “Care Coordinator” about the situation. Truly terrible to take advantage of people who are obviously looking for assistance.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They are super nice at first, then they show their true colors. They prescribe medications that don’t work, and refuse to make changes although you’re paying for it yourself. They treat you like you have no idea what you’re talking about even though you most likely have studied this before you signed up for it. They make it almost impossible to cancel service, and you have to send an email. They never answer the phone when you call them. I’m going to another therapist now. They are terrible…",cerebral-mental-health,,,

I used this card to try out cerebral, subscribed for 3 months and decided it wasn't for me. I emailed to cancel and yet they keep trying to charge my card that has no money in it luckily. They try to withdraw once a day. I had to cancel this debit card so they would stop charging me! Super sketchy. l’m just thankful it wasn't linked to my primary bank account.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"The app itself is mostly functional, and I have had good experiences with the majority of providers on the platform. The issue is that there is such high turnover that I’ve had 4 different prescribers, 3 counselors, and 2 care coordinators. It’s already more difficult to build a relationship over a screen, so the lack of continuity of care impacts this even more. I still stick with it because it’s the cheapest way to get the meds that I know work for me.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"My prescription for my antidepressants expired which I had been taking for 3 years and I reached out several times over 5 days to get ahold of my prescriber, which my care specialist couldn’t even do, to get them renewed. I started experiencing withdraw symptoms that were only going to get worse with no update or care from anybody at Cerebral. I was forced to contact my old doctor for help in order to avoid any further symptoms. I was abandoned, glad they added a cancelation button at the end of May, must be anticipating a lot.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The concept is great and we got off to a great start so I am thankful for that when the waiting time to see a doctor locally is months long. But they are not staffed to actually respond timely or accurately or fully to issues.  I’m now 30-some days into a prescription that is working, I feel so much better but they sent too few days and I’ve been trying for almost 2 weeks to get it fixed.  I run out in 5 days and cannot get an actual straight answer from anyone.  This is dangerous.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have canceled twice. They will not stop charging me.  I have lost $170 in 2 months and they are trying to charge another $85. I have called, emailed dozens of times, and have been given “sorry to see you go” emails and still am being charged.

Please do not use this service. They are great at helping with scheduling and counseling but have caused far more stress than I had due to this.  I will have to close down my credit card because they close my account.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I got in to try and get mental support since COVID started so I didn’t have to go anywhere. 
Once I subscribed I realized it wasn’t for me so I canceled, which if you don’t cancel at least a week before next bill you will get charged again. And they make the cancellation very difficult. 
After I canceled they continued to bill me 2 more times over drafting my account. I’ve had to leave multiple email and wait on hold for hours to get them to stop. Just beware before you jump into this",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"All they focus on is pushing depression medications. I spoke about how I was depressed but have been much better for almost two years. The prescriber didn’t hear that. She heard that I am still depressed which I never said. I went for ADHD help. I was prescribed Ritalin in my youth (by an actual doctor). It helped! I got off it in my adolescence. Big mistake. I need help focusing, but they just want to shove antidepressants down my throat. If you want help with ADHD, good luck. Waste of time. Go see an actual doctor. Not a nurse practitioner who only hear what she wants to.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Explained that I have anxiety disorder and insomnia. Told what I was prescribed in the past THAT ACTUALLY WOKED for me because I’m 40 years old and I’ve already had meds tried on me. 
Explained that I was prescribed hydroxyzine just recently and it made me feel like I had drank 6 cups of coffee. 
The recent doctor just prescribed it again and now I’m having bladder issues and I’m lying awake for hours in my bed!!! 
So on top of the anxiety I have more anxiety and I’m Wideawake and I have TERRIBLE URGENCY TO PEE!!  
I’m tired of doctors not listening to me and treating me as their medical guinea pig!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Met with someone they “listened” then prescribed me something that didn’t deal with my main issue. I then reached out to support after researching what I was given and they said I couldn’t meet with someone new for over a month. I then asked if I could get quick help as the medication was negatively impacting me and they didn’t have anyone to talk to for weeks. I then asked to cancel and got no response just locked out of my account…honestly terrible experience I’m surprised this is even legal.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I do not recommend using Cerebral. They will tell you they are sending your prescription to the pharmacy and then turn around and not let you know that there are no providers in my state. I had to pull teeth to get an answer from somewhere about where my prescription was….After they take your money…it’s sad that people seek treatment and get treated like they are just another number. No wonder so many people have issues and can’t get the help they need. I do NOT recommend this crappy company.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,It’s tax season and I had saved up just enough to pay my taxes. Then this app hit me with the $325 fee. Be warned! This treatment is super expensive! I would rather take my chances being off my meds and have no therapy than be in bad standing with the IRS. There are no refunds. The contract details are explicit but when you’re desperate you think you can make things work. Nope! It’s a dangerous financial contract. See someone in there person instead who can assess your situation and gauge what would actually be most helpful and most feasible.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was able to meet with a prescriber quickly, but she told me she was going to consult her peers about the best course of action then never spoke to me again. When I talked to my care counselor, she stated it doesn’t usually work this way and she would work to get me a new prescriber, but I have yet to hear from her at all. There’s also no way to schedule new appointments, it keeps glitching every time I try to use Face ID to open it, and I get non-stop unsolicited emails. I would not recommend this service to anyone.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Signed up for the service yesterday but found that there were no providers in my area that actually have reviews anywhere. Reached out to customer support yesterday to request that they cancel my subscription and refund me but no response. Called the customer support phone number and although it is during their business hours, I was left on hold for 11 minutes and ultimately had to leave a voicemail. Really poor customer service experience. Please refund my money!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,First I went on thinking this would be a good option because I live in a rural area.  They don’t tell you upfront what the cost is or if your insurance is accepted until after you sign up. Now I have tried cancelling at least twice and they are still billing me $85 a month. I have been on hold with their billing department for 10 minutes hoping to talk with someone to get this resolved and maybe get a refund. I never used the service.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This has been the worst experience I’ve ever had. The medication I was prescribed put me in the hospital to get my stomach pumped because of how bad the reaction was. I tried getting in contact with my prescriber and had 4 different appointments scheduled because they kept being cancelled by the prescriber. I still haven’t been able to see the prescriber. 

Not only that, but I asked for the medicine to be cancelled because I had a severe allergic reaction to it and they charged me for a second refill of it. 

I also never got an ADHD appointment made like the prescriber said she would do, so that never went anywhere. 

Don’t use this service if you want to be seen by competent people. They clearly don’t care about their clients. AND there’s no way to cancel your subscription without calling the support center. Ridiculous.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They will happily take your money, but good luck getting treatment. The providers don’t show up to appointments, can’t get refills, customer service is terrible. All they care about is taking your money and not your mental health or well being. This is supposed to be more convenient because it’s online, but they never have times available. I have tried 4 times to get an appointment. So frustrating and they show no compassion when voicing complaints. Just “here’s how to cancel”",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This is a bait and switch falsely advertised service and they do NOT provide the care you pay for. Horrible “coordinator” lied and gaslit me about the services they were withholding and stringing me along for. Please pay attention to the bad reviews here. Cerebral is a nightmare  that smiles and says nice sounding words at you while they take your money and don’t deliver. For example, the reply to this review: “Molly” sounded so nice and sincere so I emailed her immediately after she posted her reply. Guess what? SHE NEVER REPLIED TO MY EMAIL! Par for the course. Total money grab scam. RUN!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was diagnosed bipolar after having a 15 min phone call with this psychiatrist. She had no interest in discussing my recent traumas - she made up her mind in a serious diagnosis based on a 15 minute meeting

I recently lost my husband and am months away from losing my sister. I reached out to cerebral for help and after explaining my situation, I was diagnosed as bipolar and put on medication. I have a degree in human psychology and she basically checked a few boxes before providing feedback that I was bipolar. This site is obviously meant for pill pushing.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,We already know that it’s hard enough with diagnosis’s to take action and seek treatment and I hate that finally I tried to take a step forward and it took me backwards. My prescriber did not show up to my first appointment…. The app continues to say I haven’t finished onboarding even after I made appointments with both the prescriber and the care counselor. My first experience so far has me defeated and ready to give up already and that’s beyond unfortunate. Just really really disappointed.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This company took my money and provided no services in return. They said they could not prescribe the medication I needed in my state. But no one thought it was important to tell me that before two months of payment were completed. Then when I asked for customer service and a refund no help was provided. The provider that I saw was amazing and very helpful. I just wish the company had some of the same insight that she did. Don’t waste your time or money there are many other websites.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Cerebral only cares about money, and not any kind of well being. During my time i was sent 3 medication bottles of substitutes for Zoloft, after specifically telling my prescriber i’m not comfortable with taking pills due to past trauma. After asking to cancel, they proceed to stretch the waiting process and charge you one last time before you leave. It’s disgusting to see this behavior from a company who claims to care for their customers, the people who truly need it and will trust them with guidance..",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Please do not go through this app, it was such a huge waste of money. They placed me in the wrong state though I did everything on my end to prevent that. The prescribers don’t have availability for weeks nor do the therapist. Customer service is not helpful in the least bit. Reaching out for help hasn’t been easy and this made it so much harder. On top of the major issues this app and company present, there are bugs on the app and overall this has been a horrible experience.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Spent like 15 mins on the phone with a person from this app and tbh I get better care going to my local ER this app and the people who run it are jokes feel like I was taken like a dang fool they really don’t help if you can or you have a way to find someone local because this app is ridiculous and they also send meds via fedex mine was shipped two weeks still haven’t received them can’t to talk to anyone so again if your looking for real mental help this app isn’t the app for you!!!!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’ve been paying for this “service” for months. NO counseling sessions - every one has been unexplainably cancelled and then there’s no more appointments for a month and then they cancel my prescription was never sent to the pharmacy…. I paid a ton of money into this for NO help or even a session. No help they basically just stole my money each month. Never even got to meet my counselor after 3 months of payment. It’s a scam and causing genuine harm. 

the app itself is fine - it’s the service that’s AWFUL",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I contacted the platform for counseling about an emergency situation with my adult child. It wrecked me and I needed to talk through options.

It took two weeks before they allowed me to make an appointment… for a week later.

The session was supposed to lead to more counseling, but the very first thing was “what meds are you on?” “Oh, we cannot give you anything…” “You don’t want a prescription? Really? Then what do you want?”

Never mind that I completed my profile in excruciating detail. The therapist never even read any of it.

Then she was supposed to schedule a followup, but disconnected from me before doing so.

Now, a month later, still nothing. So I cancelled my plan. And that created a kerfuffle that ended in me having to block them.

Just go get a real therapist. In person. The price is the same.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I have to call every month to get my prescription sent to the pharmacy even though it’s supposed to be done on a schedule. Now I’m completely out of meds even though I’ve been messaging every day for the past four days. The counseling is absolutely useless with the sporadic schedule they offer but I figured it would at least be a source for anti depressants. What kind of service makes you fight for the meds they prescribed? This service is absolutely terrible.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This experience with Cerebral feels like a massive bait & switch. They advertised “help for ADHD meds”, but in reality they put you on anxiety meds first then you have to stick around for at least how many more months at full price until that is actually addressed? While speaking with therapist she was checked out and barely mumbling responses even when I had just said “he tried to kill me”. I still feel like I’m handling this alone while begging for the help I signed up to get. Explain how this is good patient care?!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Counselor at first meeting turn off video and I heard he was eating chips making noise while counseling session with me.
I gave this feedback to cerebral and they didn’t follow up or apologize or changed to someone else. I did not want to get depressed and see this unprofessional person with out of pocket pay. I discontinued this membership. It is also hard to make an appointment. 
Will never go back. There are plenty of services available. I highly want to discourage this company.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Cerebral doesn’t offer treatment for people with suicidal depression. They prescribe meds that have Suicidal urges as a side effect then they  cut your from the service so if something bad happens it’s not there fault . Psychiatric prescribers get away with destroying people and there’s no recourse or action to appeal everything . This might be fine for anxiety treatment but with depression I would highly recommend other services . I can say that I’m honestly worse off after the treatment I got from this service .,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This is by far the worst company/system I have ever worked with!  The customer service is trying to be supportive but they do not have any control.
Spend the money for therapy and prescriptions.
1) one meeting with prescriber - consultant issue with sound on the prescribers part. 
2) prescriber did prescribe medication and counseling.
3) 3 days later- no follow up. No prescription. Nothing.
4) try to log into app (again) blank screen
5) go on via web- find out my prescriber quit.
6) then get help desk people on. They find me someone new (no appointments until July) thanks for the favor.
7) promise me they are calling me back with my prescription to be called into my pharmacy to make sure I actually get it.
8) guess what…nothing called in again.
9) this is a JOKE!

$325 per month for NOTHING!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I’m honestly shocked this is legal. Horrible customer support. No humans to actually talk to. My appointment was cancelled without any notification and then I was told I needed to reschedule with a new prescriber. Unfortunately there was no availability for nearly an entire month. I was expecting a lot more after all their “testimonials”. I probably won’t receive a refund either even though I was never renders any sort of service whatsoever. This company is pathetic and should be ashamed for taking advantage of a vulnerable population of humans.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"It took 3 weeks to get an appointment and then bathe you before you even talk to anyone.

I don’t have insurance, which is why I wanted to give this service a try and it was 400$ to get the medication like what???

1,"It seems great for the first month or two. Affordable mental healthcare and all that. But just wait until your $30/mo turns into $345/mo. These people are full of it. They told me my therapist that was assigned to me is out of my network so they need me to pay more. When that has nothing to do with me and wasn’t my fault.

1,"Initially i joined this app to be diagnosed/prescribed. Advertising indicated i would be able to talk to someone and be prescribed. Set my appointments with a “care counselor”(not a licensed professional) 
So most of the things i shared with her, she would suggest to tell the prescriber.. not what advertised ..
I set multiple appointments with the prescriber that were canceled on multiple times, and last minute.

The cancellation process is horrible. 
It is ONLY VIA EMAIL, they will not actually adress your email, they just send a formulated email stating that the cancellation PROCESS is starting. 
Its been 8 days since my cancellation process has started and I’m still charged the 85$ service fee.

But i guess thats what you get when you click on a TikTok ad.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

I had to wait almost three months for a provider. Signing up in January and having to wait until march to be seen. No thank you. Just go local. It’s not worth the money. No medication, no help. Just more money out of my bank account. Not great for my mental state.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,They won’t issue refunds even if you haven’t used the app and they sent an email saying the account will be deactivated because you they didn’t take any out in June since I didn’t have any money in the account.

I requested a way to get a refund with didn’t come. Overall, I wasted $300 on Cerebral.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Takes weeks and weeks to be seen, they charge you the whole time, they do not refund all your money if you cancel. I was charged $30, partially refunded upon immediate cancellation, and I would’ve paid over $120 before I could be seen. That $7.99 a week or whatever they offer? That’s a scam too. I don’t know how they calculated what they charged me, I did not approve the charge before it went through, it is difficult to cancel and they are poorly responsive. Beware.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Do not use this platform for your medical needs. They run a very dishonest company and are not upfront with you about costs. This is just a tech version of everything that is wrong with the US health care system. They do not care for your well being.

I would highly recommend not to use this service and contact your local Dr for advice.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This app is dishonest, has no support and will make unauthorized charges to your card. Signed up for what i thought was 30 dollars a month, did not use the service and cancelled and the next month was charged 85 dollars for a service i never used.

Just because some youtuber said it was great means absolutely nothing.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Definitely take back my review after my first great month I got a new doctor that decided to decline all of the new meds that I’ve already been on for a month I pay out of pocket so 185$ isn’t worth her saying maybe next month I will prescribe the prescription you have remaining refills on. Ridiculous it’s a scam to say the least they just want your money for the month. By the way they rarely have appointments I still haven’t see my “counselor” and I been with them for two months now.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"at first i enjoyed the convenience of cerebral but it’s lack of organization and strategy has become very apparent. 

in the beginning i felt cared for, prescriber was attentive and involved, but as times gone on it’s become almost impossible  to schedule with them. even worse is prescriptions expire without any note from cerebral on if it will be renewed. you’ll need to manually reach out to see if your prescription will be renewed. this seems dangerous for people on prescriptions that need a wind down period. 

on a more basic level, their app is hot garbage. every time i open it i’m signed out, deep links don’t work, notifications never disappear. seems their entire operation needs work. for startups this is expected, but in healthcare it’s unacceptable. do better please!",cerebral-mental-health,,,

But I wouldn’t have come to leave a review if it wasn’t for the fact that they make it really hard/a lengthy process to cancel.

1,"I signed up and was charged. I tried for 3 months to get into my account and was told I didn’t have an active account and to pay sign up fee. Yet the already had my sign up fee and were charging me each month while telling me I had no account. 
Be careful if you sign up. I lost over $100 with nothing to show for it except a bunch of emails going back and forth and a will will stop Amy future charges but sorry no refunds.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Spoke to a prescriber who did not speak clear English or understand me. Managed to get her to say she would refill a medication I was already on, but that never got sent and all of my messages (six of them) were ignored over the course of 48 hours. Ended up having withdrawals bc I couldn’t get the meds filled in time - because I couldn’t get ahold of anyone with Cerebral - and then was denied a refund (no refunds whether or not you end up using the service). Horrible experience, and it’s a SCAM.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,So they messed up my payment plan . And didn’t send me my medication after numerous attempts to correct the problem of me simply being able to pay …. And it took way too long to sort it out . I still haven’t received the medication I was prescribed and the order wasn’t processed until a week later … so I’m still waiting . I hope their customer service has improved,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"They were sending me me a bottle of pills every other week charging, me when every bottle was meant to last for 2 months. Then they started sending me medications that I never talked to anyone about adding. Your lucky if you talk to your prescriber or counselor once a month. They switched prescribers twice on me. This app definitely requires a lot of patience I do not recommend it for anyone that needs serious help.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I started with cerebral and first off it is extremely difficult to even get an appointment. At first, I thought it was only $40 per appointment which is not a bad price. Not at all it cost me $365 for a month!!!! As soon as I seen this charge I cancelled all appointments and requested a refund because I needed that money for rent. No one cared at all. I called in and phone team couldn’t help me, I emailed and they told me to call the phone team???? This is a straight scam",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"…. Then I immediately started having problems. After four more weeks I feel confident in saying that with my experience this has been just as frustrating, if not slightly more frustrating, than doing this all traditionally. At least if I was seeing a local doc, there would be someone I could call TO RESOLVE MY URGENT ISSUE. Will likely cancel once they can keep it together long enough to get my first refill shipped out.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I signed up In the beginning January and didn’t like the service so tried to cancel. I followed there scummy cancellation process. Then they never canceled it. I sent the cancellation email on the 17 of January and was still billed for February. There customer service in non existent also. I have called but it’s a stupid answering service we’re they will get back to you with in a day. This is a scam don’t get it. I would leave a -5 stars but you can’t.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up through Cerebral for $30 a month, then found out it’s actually $85. So I asked to cancel my subscription but to still be able to have my appointment today. Instead they canceled all my appointments and ended my subscription. So I literally just wasted $30 just to download a stupid app which I know won’t be refunded. Cerebral, what’s the point in having a phone number if the system just answers to say “email us?” Ridiculous and do better Cerebral.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They give you a false sense of hope and a care team that after upon paying they tell you they are under qualified and do not have the proper resources to treat you. This is dependent on which state you live in. They were kind but talked in circles for two appointments before telling me they cannot help me. At least not yet. Not until they grow their care team. No carry over refills on ANY of my medications, even those that are NOT antipsychotics  or mood stabilizers. Very disappointing",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This service is a scam. I decided to try Cerebral because they emailed me a discount. I was charged $99 for my first month despite having the discount and 2 different insurances. I was charged $226 for the 2nd month unknowingly as I was never sent a billing update or notice of the change in charges. All in all I was charged $325 for 1 therapy appointment where the therapist was not even fully licensed and had only worked as a Life Coach previous to her time at Cerebral. Don’t waste your money!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Signed up May 2nd, they matched me with a therapist and provider right away. I got a message 10 minutes before my initial meeting with a provider that I was a no show and would have to reschedule. Then I got a message that my therapist is too full and I would need to pick a new one. When I go to do that it says there are no appointments available. Literally just paying to have someone prescribe a medicine that I don’t want.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I signed up for this before my work day started and was not really able to look into it. Over the past 12 hours I have received 4 different emails from Cerebral and that was enough for me to unsubscribe and tell them not to contact me. Change your marketing approach ! People don’t want to receive that many emails in one day from the same company trying to sell you something. Absolutely ridiculous,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,That say that they are able to provide the high quality of care but when it comes down to it the company has many restrictions as to the services it can really provide. Beware ask what you need before signing up as they will just try to take your money as they did with me and set you up with their highest subscription and schedule you a months later while you’re still paying a subscription.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I was shuffled around to several different people. Then when I finally started talking to someone there was no follow up. I also made a request to get medical records and it took three weeks. And because of how they worded my medical records which was totally inappropriate I was denied short term disability. Still no one reached out to me to see if I still needed help. But they did reach out to me about a $21 charge of them from January 18 six months later.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Their refund policy is ridiculous. They were about to steal 20 bucks from me until I mentioned disputing the charge with my financial institution. I canceled a subscription within and hour of starting, before I finished onboarding because the service was unclear. They tried to give me $9 left of my $30 until 2 days and like 7 emails later. They have bad values and are dishonest from my experience. The rep was professional and probably just followed policy.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Kept getting passed from care team to care team too often, along with my counselor missing our session made me disappointed in Cerebral. I was excited to get help but now feel like my concerns for my mental health are not being taken seriously. I was prescribed medication quickly so that’s something but other than that this has been underwhelming.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This has been such a terrible experience for myself. It started off okay but you pay $99 for a consultation and then I was scheduled for a therapy session which never took place bc they kept rescheduling...I finally tried to cancel 3 months later after they continued to charge me $99 a month. I am still fighting to get this canceled so they’ll stop charging me for products/services I never received. I had to call my bank and about to call the business bureau.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"If you want to cancel your membership at any point.. GOOD LUCK. I have canceled my membership MULTIPLE times and gotten emails confirming my cancellation and yet have been charged the monthly fee twice now, I’m having to cancel my card due to this. Any time I’ve tried to call customer support to explain and fix the issue I am hung up on by customer support. Every. Single. Time. 
Completely inappropriate and shady business practices from a company intended to improve your mental health!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"When you go through the initial intake process, they charge you before even letting you check if your insurance covers the service. I emailed them immediately to let them know I didn’t want to use the platform since my insurance doesn’t cover it and I didn’t realize I was already going to be charged but they won’t refund me since their team didn’t process the request quickly enough",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,They overmedicated me. I was just supposed to be on Zoloft but they also sent propanalol and seroquel. The medication had the wrong labeling and I was severely affected. When I told them my concerns they basically shrugged their shoulders and then continued to send the other medications and charging me for it even though I said I did not wish to take them. I haven’t been able to get through to a customer service rep for a refund. This app is super sketchy and I am so disappointed.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,Their cancellation method is a little ridiculous in my opinion. Considering you pay for the month worth of treatment and you cancel they revoke any privilege to medication or therapy for the rest of the month. And you have to wait “2 days” for them to cancel your subscription. It’s odd. I dont recommend. Just please visit your local social services or your insurance company cause this isn’t worth $85 or more a month.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"My wife installed the app and was immediately bombarded to upgrade from the website. It’s very difficult to cancel and needed to email support to cancel. Then support told us the company does not offer refunds. 

There’s very limited appointments from the app . I went to my credit card company to dispute the charges to get our refund. Do not install! 

Shame on Simone Biles and other celebrities and sponsors for advertising such a scam company.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,It’s expensive unreliable and condescending. I got my meds via mail ONCE in 3-4 months. They cut down my medications drastically causing my depression and anxiety to get worse… so much worse. They also lie abt the true service they provide - my prescriber appointment never lasted more than 4-5 mins. I’ve been on a mental health medication plan for over a decade w no problems but these last few months with this service has put me in a more precarious situation than before I tried it.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"i have a handful of medications i am already on and i also wanted to explore new ones, but apparently that’s too much to deal with for cerebral. after the first 30 minute appointment with a prescriber i was told “Your account will be closed since your prescriber has recommended i seek in-person care”. and to add to that when i was chatting with customer service about getting a refund I never once got a straight answer.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The medication teams are highly unqualified. Their “prescribers” aren’t psychiatrists. No credentials, no bios, no info. Nurse practitioner maybe, but you don’t know because they don’t say. You just pick one randomly. Care teams are dangerously unqualified. Their credentials were going through traumas themselves or believing people should be their best selves. Highest I saw was masters in psychology which doesn’t equal mental health professional. They should NOT be advising people with depression and anxiety. I cancelled immediately.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"The first care counselor had me on medications that were interfering with birth control, but was not notified until four months into the process. seem to have a good idea, but not a solid back end or  enough skilled counselors. most of the therapy sessions are pushed along faster so that only five of the thirty minute sessions are covered.  the bill charges are all sporadic. hey, still better than nothing",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Unclear about where you have to live in order to see certain providers resulting in multiple appointments and loss of time. Will take your money and then only offer care options that require you to sign up for their more expensive packages, do not listen to concerns about this from their patients. Do not waste your time/money you will definitely regret using this service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Terrible Service - two months they weren’t able to send my 10mg lexapro prescription to the pharmacy, after claiming it was there and then giving me run around about if I was even prescribed it; Then they refused to send the refill over if I wouldn’t see a provider again because they want extra $$$$, it’s honestly been a mess 🤮 

This service could be awesome but it’s not. It’s a bunch of useless money hungry people.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"They advertise availability of controlled substances. That is not the case depending on which state you live in, they will not be able to prescribe them. Make sure you check before signing up because cancelling your plan is difficult, and you might have to end up just getting a new credit/debit card. But, there is nothing wrong the NPs or therapists to my knowledge.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I loved my therapy sessions w Arlene, but she randomly canceled my appointment and then drastically changed her availability to only unrealistic hours. Then, the only options for replacements were not even therapists, that’s when I realized this app is a joke. No one responds when I ask questions. When they do respond, they say they will get right back to me with a solution and then says or weeks go by and no solution is offered. Save your money! Too expensive and useless!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The app was difficult to use, it asked for confirmation but didn’t give me clear steps on how to do that, I was cancelled without notice and they changed my therapist that I had originally chosen without letting me choose the next one, I need to reschedule but the date I had originally chose was the only day I was available that month and so I had no choice but to cancel. If all mental health services are this difficult, then I give up",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They have MULTIPLE LAWSUITS against them. They WILL HARM YOU! Anywhere is better than here! They had me quit my sleep medication and offered no alternatives. I sleep once every 25 hours and they still refuse to help me with anything “because I took Benadryl”. You’re better off flushing your money. There are lawsuits because they prescribe without caring or paying attention and have harmed multiple people, worsening multiple peoples conditions. They’re being shut down.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They initially offer a $30 monthly rates but quickly it’s $85 per month. It was billing to an HSA that I didn’t regularly check. And the $55 monthly increase caught me completely by surprise. With one 10 minute prescriber visit and one 30 minute “rushed” counseling session per month, you are much better off spending that $85 with a real counseling provider and a legit session through your normal health insurance. Maybe cool if you don’t have health insurance but not good value.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"False and misleading marketing is going to get this company in legal trouble. There is no 24/7 message service, and their providers are treated like 3rd party contractors as they have no way to actually get in touch with their psychologists and therapists. It takes a week for anything to be accomplished, if at all. This service is a total train wreck and I guarantee people are suffering as a result of their incompetence. Don’t be fooled by the glowing reviews of this service & app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Communication. Super important when you’re experiencing a mental health crisis. The app has a messaging platform that looks and behaves like a live messaging board, however it is not. It can take up to two days to get a response from anyone. It’s also impossible to speak to any of your doctors when and if you need to. It’s kind of ridiculous, and full of false hope.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I cancelled my membership Jan 8 because of an error or something it did not go through. When it was cancelled a day later not only was I immediately blocked out of the account unable to see notes and everything, but cerebral STILL charged me $325 for a FULL month of therapy & medication help that I’m not allowed to even use. Terrible business antics while dealing with people suffering from mental issues 
Sent from my iPhone",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I signed up during the first month discount time. I scheduled my first appointment with the prescriber and a care counselor. The day for my first appointment comes around. The prescriber doesn’t show up. I message to reschedule the appointment in the app. No response. I email the support team. No response. I messaged the app again about canceling my subscription. No response. I emailed the cancel email. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE. No options to get my refund. I have to file a dispute through card company.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have a $30 charge, $109 charge and a pending charge on my card for $325 and i haven’t even finished setting up my account yet. $464 for NOTHING. Why would you charge hundreds of dollars before giving someone the chance to decide if they even want to use your app? It’s like an actual doctors office charging you for a visit just for thinking about making an appointment. $325…. Someone had better email me, STAT.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They make you pay for services before you get to see what they have to offer, they only have two options for therapists and if you don’t like either one there is no way to cancel your payment and no way to get out. You have to choose between the two. I made an appointment and the therapist did not show up. I should have read the reviews before I signed up out of desperation.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The prescriber was fine, but the mandated therapist was a joke - inattentive, forgetful, and dim. You can’t get an appointment for weeks or months at a time, but they start charging you on day one. Canceling is intentionally difficult. There is no way to do it on the app and they try to make you fill out a form which is basically a sales pitch to try to stop you. The convenience of the online prescription is far outweighed by all the other expense and irritation.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This app is trash. And the people who run it are just as bad. They charge you $30 up front just to fill out a survey of your symptoms, etc. only to get to the end and realize there are no appointments available for at least a month.. by then the full price kicks in for $80/ month and no service. 

I wish I had read some of the reviews before wasting time and money on them.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Don’t take part in any trials because even if you don’t begin service or use anything you will be charged by cerebral $85 even without trying or using the product or services. Customer service might be the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. They have “strict” no refund policy on anything even if it was a terrible experience or by mistake. Do yourslef a favor and please don’t download this. It does not help.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Cerebral had a very uninviting procedure, before you can talk to anyone you have to schedule appointments which are always almost a week away. The only reason I got this app was for ADHD but they gave me medication that caused suicidal thoughts. They never respond to the chat on the same day, it takes at least 10-12 hours to get a response. And they are not willing to compromise or actually help in a meaningful way.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Literally the worst app possible if you want immediate help. They advertise that you can get help right away. No. Not the case in the slightest. I paid over a hundred dollars then AFTER they informed me I couldn’t even talk to someone for weeks. I cancelled my membership immediately. Literally had the subscription for under 48 hours. Used NO services what so ever and they refuse to give me even half my money back. DO NOT BUY THIS APP UNLESS YOU CAN JUST PUT A PIN IN YOUR MENTAL HEALTH FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG OR ELSE YOURE JUST GONNA BE DEPRESSED AND BROKE.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They regularly double charge, charge for services you wanted cancelled and then give you the run around to get it fixed. They refuse to refund the incorrect charges and they make you go through a loop of emails to cancel. They pick and choose which medications they prescribe, doing more harm to patients who have specific needs for something more than low grade antidepressants. Avoid them if possible.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up for the service because there was a promotion and I could really talk to a therapist. The promotion was for one month, when I went to schedule a session with a therapist there was nothing available within the month time frame. I immediately messaged customer service and canceled like they told me to. I reached out again and was told I’d only be getting a partial refund. Why??!! I literally didn’t use the service at all! What a scam!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"If I could rate this zero stars I would. They told me I needed to make an initial payment of 30 dollars, for absolutely nothing, and then proceeded to tell my my insurance was not accepted after charging me. I emailed them asking if I was able to receive a refund after I was practically scammed out of my money, and they sent a rude email back telling me I could not. ridiculous, don’t waste your time.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This service is a scam. The bargain basement ‘medical professionals’ for this app are just there to give you placebos and take ur money. Do NOT come to them with any REAL problems, they will be of no help. Potential to make u worse actually because the lack of care is insulting. Texting back and forth with so called medical staff to no resolve is just so unprofessional that it’s hard to put into words. So ur paying to text with someone who can barely do their job. Scam scam scam.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Worst logistics and customer service I have EVER dealt with. They promise to call you back when you need medication refilled and they just gaslight you with you want to hear to get you off the phone and happy. And don’t hear back still. Justin is a diva if you get him/her on the phone… I’m sorry get ready for the attitude and no help. Save your money and use on beer. Better mental health plan than these bozos,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Too expensive + a shady support service. I canceled my subscription back in April to find out that they have STILL BEEN CHARGING MY CARD, plus I haven’t received this medication that they’ve been screwing out of me. What a cool way to worsen my anxiety and steal my money considering I make minimum wage and now can’t afford my dentist appointment. Will vehemently tell anybody who will listen not to use this service. Thieves!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I paid for weekly therapy sessions and it’s been almost a month without a single one. They started me on a medication and haven’t followed up with me and have ignored all my cautions about needing to be seen. This subscription service is going to lead to a lot of deaths because it doesn’t take responsibility for itself. It needs to be shut down so it doesn’t continue to prey on the weak and vulnerable. Disappointed isn’t even a word I’d use; unsafe.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Therapists turn over way to frequently causing me to have to rehash my trauma over and over for the new provider. They will NOT give refunds after charging over $700 and only being able to see someone 3 times. I’m worse now than when I started and now I have a financial hardship. What a terrible model for someone suffering from mental health. Do yourself a favor and choose a different platform.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have not had this for a month. I cannot view my PAYMENTS or payment history NOR can I see if in fact, I got a discount using my insurance. You cannot tell me I have spent more money on 2 sessions in less than a month for crappy results. The people I spoke with are great BUT me meds never got sent and I do not know how much money they have taken anywhere on the app! I can’t remove my method. They drained my whole HSA account.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I’d give it zero stars if I could. Paid the 30 dollars for first month then went to schedule and they were booked out for 4 months. Which mean I would’ve been charged the 80 or so dollars for the next 3 months without getting any services. I canceled my account within 20 minutes of signing up and they wont give me my 30 dollars back even though I never used ANY of their services.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Sorry but I seriously spent money on this because this is affordable only to get told by my prescriber "" um yeah. You do seem like you have ADHD but you're a female. sorry but I think you're just bipolar "" and proceeds to give me bipolar meds? guess what? I went to a actual psychiatrist, Got check 4 times because I was beyond anxious due to you guys! and indeed have ADHD! it shouldn't have been this hard and meds shouldn't be given like candy!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,Service was really great and affordable but when Therapy was no longer available in my area Cerebral changed my subscription plan without notifying me or getting my consent. The main reason I signed up is to have access to therapy appointments so no communication was really upsetting and now I have to find alternative options with no notice.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This is a great concept with poor execution. You won’t be able to use your FSA because their receipts lack details. All messages take AT LEAST 24 hours for response. Provider visits constantly cancelled (sometimes within 5 min of your appointment) & are hard to come by - expect to lapse in your medication. Technical difficulties with app & on site unresolved. When they get their stuff together it will be great. Until then RUN.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,My boyfriend and I both signed up For cerebral in late October early November. We both had to wait extremely long in crisis mode to get an appointment. No one responds to you when you need help.  My boyfriend is now in crisis mode after speaking to one of their providers who he was assured would prescribe him the medication he's been monitored on in Arizona for 8 years. She was extremely rude and acted as if my boyfriend was medication seeking. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Total waste of time and money. Spent 10 mins on my first video chat with the designated doctor and without her asking any real questions she essentially determined there’s nothing going on except “depression.” In 10 minutes. I know that isn’t the issue. I don’t feel like I was heard or evaluated in any way and I immediately cancelled my subscription. I really thought I would finally get the help I need, but not from Cerebral.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"While I think cerebral has the potential to be a great service they  have a lot of issues to figure out. 

My prescriber never showed up to my appointment causing me to run out of my prescription. No apologies. Not attempts to reschedule. Nothing. This was after never being informed that my previous prescriber had left completely. I only found that out when I couldn’t find any appointments. 

I have expressed on several occasions my concerns with struggling due to adhd and it always gets brushed over when it was the main reason I sought help through Cerebral in the first place. 

Appointments are hard to come by so I am paying $85/month for my prescription to run out? No thank you.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I signed up under the impression that X condition could be evaluated right away and it wasn’t the case. After asking for a refund the rep said the request would be processed and I’d get a response. I haven’t received one and have sent two follow up emails that have also gone without response, so I guess I’m getting ghosted.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Makes you pay before telling you they can’t prescribe the medicine in the state you live in. Wish it would have told me that before I put my card info in and they processed the fee. Took my money and can’t even get the help I needed. I looked all over the website before signing up and all it said was “certain states” but then tells you which states after you’ve paid. Wow.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,They charged me $330 a month when I signed up for a $45/month subscription. Never returned my messages and didn’t unsubscribe me when requested and kept over billing. Their psychiatrist was over 10 minutes late to a phone meeting when he knew I was on a tight timeline and just needed my prescription changed. I liken this company to a pig with lipstick—they can dress it up as much as they want buts it’s really covered in filth.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"as a person who uses apps with recurring payments I can definitively say cerebral
is without a doubt the most shady and underhanded app i have used to date. I would go as far as to call it predatory, as getting a new card will not stop them from yanking $170 out of your account (when a subscription is supposed to just be $85 a month?) via a card they have no authorization to use. Pretty despicable.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have had to go through three “providers” - all of which I couldn’t book appointments for. Nothing available for THREE YEARS out. Unbelievably bad service when I tried to follow up.

Supreme waste of money, time, everything.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They advertise start today and then after you spend a long time completing your intake info after they already charge you for a month, it then shows you that you have to wait weeks to get any type of service or to schedule your first appointment.

1,"I’ve reported these criminals to the FTC and you should too. I’m unable to schedule a meeting with ANYONE. And no one responds to help remedy this. It is also impossible to cancel so once you pay, you’d better cancel your debit card or these criminals will take 85 dollars a month to do nothing whatsoever for you. I can’t believe this company is allowed to exist with how terrible they treat people but I guess I shouldn’t be. That’s the world.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This service will make it impossible to cancel your subscription. Providers are fine but I no longer want the service and they’re making it extremely hard for me to cancel. I had to cancel my credit cards to stop them from taking my money, there was no other way.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Signed up for therapy. The day after I signed up therapy was paused for some reason in my state. I canceled and asked for refund. They said they can't refund cause it's a prescription model even if I didn't use the services they can't give money back. I couldn't use it they didn't allow therapy in Minnesota anymore though them. So they couldn't provide me services then told me I still had to pay. Scam.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This service is awful and these providers are hardly “qualified professionals.” Please trust me when I tell you that you can find much better services at a local provider near you!!!! Nearly everyone is providing virtual mental health services these days and you don’t need to spend your money here!! Please find someone better qualified because this company does not have those people!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I had a great first 2 sessions and then the wheels came off. My therapist canceled 5 sessions in a row. The meds they sent made me gain 30lbs in 3 months. I asked to cancel sessions and they reported them as no show. I rejected a delivery of meds after asking them to stop sending them and they continue billing and sending. Impossible to cancel the app. They reassigned me to a ransom therapist without consent. Untrustworthy for anyone seeking mental health help. SKIP THIS. They ought to be out of business.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up for this, and I was supposed to pick a therapist, but somehow they paired me with a random one that isn’t available for months, and then only at 5 in the morning.

There is no way to change this without going through customer support, which takes forever. And you can’t see the list of people anymore.

It’s horrible, and just exacerbating my issues.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Disjointed user experience. Things like changing therapists should be able to be done by the user in the app, not by having to play days of telephone with customer service. Additionally, they don’t take the insurance providers that are listed on the site. I have Anthem of California, which is listed as an “in-network” provider only to be informed once signing up that it is not accepted without any real explanation.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I used cerebral for about a month and had numerous miscommunications with my counselors and coordinator. 

Whenever I approached my coordinator about a scheduling error, she assure me I was wrong despite having all of the information in front of me. 

I never received my prescriptions, despite them assuring me they would A. be in the mail and then later B. would be at my local pharmacy. Both of which never happened. 

And then after I tried canceling I had to jump through several hoops, and then they offered me multiple discounts to stay on. Telling me perhaps there’s a lot of Turnover. 

All and all I personally feel like I spent $80 to receive no medicine and get lightly gaslight.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up after I saw an add on tiktok. Don’t fall for it it’s a scam, and once you sign up they don’t give you your money back, even if you haven’t used any services. The only thing I can see this leading to is a lot of unhappy customers and bad reviews. To cerebral I say take a close look at your business model and stop preying on people who need a mental health resource.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"For a very high monthly price you get 30 min with a prescriber and 30 min of something that was supposed to be counseling but was more like a substitute teacher reading from a script to students. When I called to be switched to another counselor, I was told that I would
Be charged an ADDITIONAL $30. Save your money. Do NOT try this platform. It is dangerous to prescribe someone a new medication and not provide any follow-up. HORRIFIC treatment of patient.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I found this app to be incredibly buggy to the point where I couldn’t book an appointment with a provider. I finally was able to do so manually (with the help of their support desk) only to have my prescriber quit within a few weeks, leaving my prescriptions unrefilled and with no choice but to go off of my meds. Such an incredibly pathetic and unprofessional group of people.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I truly don’t know how they have 4.7 stars… I am now on day 3 of being out of my medication that I’ve been on for years now. My prescriber hasn’t responded to inquiries for over a week and a half. I am absolutely astonished at how poor this service is and how little they seem to care about my health. This is now affecting my life & I have little to no answers on how I’m able to get my necessary medications.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,The app itself isn’t great. Calls are super quiet and impossible to hear. The layout is not great. The care provided isn’t great either. Getting shuffled around to different therapists is annoying at best. I don’t want to sit here and spend weeks getting comfortable with someone to rinse and repeat the process again over and over.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Genuinely can’t find anyone to talk to on this app. 3 different counselors have cancelled or no showed or canceled on me, and the 4th didn’t have any availability.  I’m approaching my second month of billing and I’m yet to meet with a single person. Support has been unresponsive/unhelpful, and no one is responding in my patient portal. Genuinely have no idea how this has a 4.7/5 rating if anyone has nearly the same experience I’m having",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Only appointment was a month out, with an inconsistent job it’s hard to schedule. Got locked out of the account but they still charge me. This app is horrible. If you want your mental health worse than look no further. Want to feel like a burden to others and that you aren’t being listened to, ask for customer service. Want anxiety about your financial issues, here a black hole.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Was literally zero help. No services ever received but they sure did charge me. 
Customer service is useless. They offered me $9.00 back… I would love to see the itemized statement on how they got to that number. Apparently your initial payment is just for the “access to the app”. So even if you cancel within a few days and receive zero service they keep the money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I haven’t had a therapy session yet, or received a prescription yet, but they’ve already charged me $130+, and are trying to charge me $320 more. 

Also they schedule the prescription and therapy with different people, they’re unrelated, and your prescription appointment will be before your therapy appointment. To me that sounds sketchy and weird, unless the person knows exactly what prescription they need ahead of time.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Never have appointments. Charge you your first month even though you can’t get an appointment. Care counselor is useless, literally sends you information you can google yourself. Was charged three times and saw a provider once and care counselor twice. Won’t refund even when you can’t see someone. You can find a better provider, I did.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Got the app in hopes of getting help without having to travel. Things seemed convenient and smooth initially but nothing seemed to be happening after I initiated appointments and treatment. Had one quick appointment via video that lasted fifteen minutes… then nothing.  I was never contacted after that for follow up. I messaged back asking what was next and got a disconnected response like they didn’t care to provide service. 

Wonder if my insurance was billed because sure felt like a scam. 

It was disappointing… hope you have better luck or find out it not worth it before you waste too much of your time. 

Didn’t work for me",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Red flags everywhere. Then when you go to cancel, you have to email a specific email address with the request, then go through there questionnaire to try and sell you more, and only if you pass can you cancel. Still waiting for my confirmation to cancel. Feels like a gym membership you can’t stop charging you. You’ve been warned.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,It’s been 8 days since my appointment and prescription.  I have not received the medication by mail nor has my pharmacy been sent the prescription.  No one will speak to you live and they don’t return app messages for 24-48 hours.  Then you get something that says “we will look into it”.  Complete garbage company.  Don’t recommend.  Wish I could give them 0 stars.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’ve had a laundry list of issues. 
- insurance shows covered in my cerebral account but the company bills 100% to my credit card. Several support tickets have been opened and they will not acknowledge the issue. 
- unable to schedule with prescriber for months on end. Availability in app does not match prescriber availability, but you’re not allowed to contact them directly to clean that up. 
- 4 months in and still no mail order prescriptions after being told the order has been submitted several times.

Tl;dr you might end up in an emergency room for a medication bridge until your next appointment that may be weeks away.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This company is a complete scam. You pay for the access to health care but you receive nothing. It took two weeks before I could get an appointment with a therapist and then she canceled on me the day of our meeting. Cerebral is refusing to refund me even though their employee denied my service. Please do not use this app because they don’t guarantee you anything other than that they’ll steal your money.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I’m having issues when I try to log in. I get a white screen that never goes away. I have updated the app, uninstalled, reinstalled, updated my phone. Everything I can think of. It’s incredibly frustrating to pay over $300 a month and not have access to the very reason I signed up.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,They can’t prescribe medication for ADHD and they will try to convince you that you may have depression instead of ADHD to keep you on their subscription. Refused to refund me for the subscription cost after offering NO help. I have been diagnosed with ADHD by leading psychiatrist in the previous state that I lived in and was looking for help in my new state and thought Cerebral would be a good service to try. Do not use if you have ADHD.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Lol had cerebral for barely a week because I asked a question to customer service that ended up with them talking in circles and around my questions. My original question was never answered and now I have a canceled membership that can’t be refunded. Just whack. It’s probably fine, just don’t talk to customer service about anything cuz they’ll just run you in circles.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Why am I paying for something that bills monthly when my first appointment is well over a month away? That makes no sense. I tried to use the in-between features/ assignments they give you but honestly they’re all a google search away. If you are seeking medical attention I would recommend seeing someone real. This is not therapy at all- I want a full refund,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"In the app it currently says $7/week for the first month. On the payment screen thereafter it states that $30 dollars is due for the first month. Somebody doesn’t know their math. When I contacted Cerebral to inquire about the payment breakdown they excused my question. Perhaps it is petty, but if it’s a tax or fee…why is it not clearly displayed. Just don’t tell me one thing and then do another.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I can never just schedule an appointment. I always have to contact someone via email for my provider. My counselor left and my next to appointments with new councilors were cancelled. I pay for monthly appointments been haven't been able to get in for two months. I'm convinced it's just an Adderall factory. 

Update: Depsite canceling in January, they charge me $85 this month! Going to have to dispute the charges now.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"You can’t see if your insurance is accepted until AFTER you pay. 
So I paid.
Then my insurance isn’t listed so I have to continue without coverage, but the app says not to worry because most people get 30-60% covered when they apply.
Okay so I go to apply my insurance and my insurance is magically on the list now I don’t have to add it. It’s on the list for outside provider coverage. 
So they knew the entire time it was outside provider coverage just wanted me to pay first.
Why couldn’t you tell me that first so I didn’t waste all of our time? 
Now I have to APPLY to cancel (email, fill out a form, wait a few days).",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,You don’t realize how far out your appointment is going to be until you pay up front (thinking it would be a fairly quick online process as it portrays). You might as well just sign up with an in-person doctor for that fact alone. It’ll happen faster.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Been trying to cancel my subscription for over two months now due to their not being any providers in my area. Cerebral continues to charge me subscription fees even though I have attempted to cancel my account twice now. If you value your time and energy STAY AWAY. All they’ll do is take your money even when they’re not able to provide you services!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,They make you pay before you find out your insurance isn’t accepted.   Lots of appointments are not convenient in my time zone. I would have to wait a month to get something that works for me. Don’t waste your money go somewhere else. Also they don’t refund if you can’t use your insurance that says scam all over it to me.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This terrible decision to be named an app of an app automatically charged me when I canceled and went through the cancellation process, their appointment times take FOREVER before you even get the stuff you pay for, then they have the audacity to force charge my account after I went through the cancellation process and when I brought it up they just DEACTIVATED my account and I haven’t received a refund yet. REFUND ME 👿👿",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Do not use them if you havent checked with your insurance first. I signed up a week ago. Have been dealing with the cancellation process since. And was not offered a full refund as I literally just signed up. 

Looking at the reviews they do not care about your overall mental well-being. Only the final billing dollar amount they can collect.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They gave me a diagnosis of cyclothymia and gave me mood stabilizers. Everything was going well as they slowly increased my dose to 100mg. Then, my prescriber got lazy and didn’t call in the next prescription and now I’m going through withdrawals and some very bad thoughts, all because of these losers. Do yourself a favor and go to a real doctor, they’ll actually do the right thing for you.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I wish I had just gone to a normal psychiatrist. It got to a point where my appointments were every three months but I still got the same charge every month. Then policies changed regarding my medication and they only chose to inform me after I had already got charged. That’s not a good way to deal with customers at all,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,It’s a great concept. Quick service for mental health. But you get what you pay for. The care counselor are useless. The nurses are over worked and my nurse has told me they are understaffed and turn around is high. I’m not overly impressed. Wish I got the same service as some of the other reviewers.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They don't care if your run out of your medicine and having withdraw symptoms. 

They take their time to respond you. So unprofessional and so irresponsible. They don't care about you health at all! I have been waiting and trying to to reach out to them last 3 days to refill my medication. They really messed up with my mental health, and my school works, and I am so much in pain.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This app is such a scam. They didn’t successfully prescribe my medication (sent it to a clinic that doesn’t exist) and when trying I address that and get it rerouted I get passed from coordinator to coordinator in an app chat and they don’t read previous messages.  I feel violated for having shared such personal information and not being well taken care of.  Cancelling. Everything.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Cerebral hasn’t been able to refill my prescription because they allegedly have been busy over the holidays. 7 days and counting off my medication and I have been reaching out for 2 weeks. My prescriber will not get back to me and my cerebral coordinator cannot get a hold of them either. They are treating this like my mental health is not important or a priority. Paying $85 a month for NOTHING.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up yesterday. they asked to upload my ID. My ID is expired by a month and they will not let me proceed. I don’t have any other form of ID they need. When I called I couldn’t speak to anyone. Left a email for customer support, waited a day for a response and it didn’t solve anything. Waste of money and made my anxiety worse.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Please be aware that this app is a complete scam and once you put your card information into their system there is no way to remove it. You also will be charged no matter what- even if no services are rendered or no care provided. They will steal money from you and it will be nearly impossible to get back.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Absolute worst service I have ever received in my entire life. If you need help, please look elsewhere!!! On top of the “therapist” not caring about my problems and being late the every meeting by atleast half an hour every time, after I cancelled my subscription a month later they still billed me 300 bucks (which they have yet to return even though they swear up and down they did)",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’ve already gone through the entire screening and sign up, paid $30 for a membership and now every time I attempt to book an initial appointment with a prescriber even a whole MONTH out I keep getting a message that says “We're sorry. This slot was *just* booked. Please select another from the list or select a different date. [conflicts with existing Appointment]”",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They made my situation worse, hard to work with, very misleading about what your actually signing up for. They assigned me with a “counselor” that was only available a few days before my first month membership expired, the days the did not work with my work schedule. Feels like they are exploiting people at there lowest or time of most need.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"[Update It’s been 2 payments and I’ve yet to meet with a prescriber.] Paid money, missed appointment, had to wait another month for an available provider, lost money. This app is on the edge of “scam” as they don’t accommodate for you in the least. You miss an appointment for any reason and you lost your money for that month.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Scammed out of my money. They will mark you no show before the appointment starts. Customer service was nice but was no help and basically left me to figure it out on my own. The rescheduling was (3 weeks out) and I would not recommend it to anyone that wants to seek help. I cancelled my subscription. Best of luck and well wishes to those who are seeking help.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Just a bunch of robbery between the monthly subscriptions plus the extra cost for the medication. I was never given the option to have my meds sent to my local CVS until after I had to get in touch with someone to find out why my medication was sitting in “tracking pending” for over 2 weeks.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Paid the trial rate for the first month and everything was fine.  After getting charged the full amount for the 2nd month a few days after the charge goes through they tell me their policy has changed and will not be able to help me but will not refund the $80 they took after providing no service.  Despicable.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Sorry but there’s no way these guys have five stars, not if they make people with anxiety and depression wait 30 days to receive medication. And why, just so that they cover their own behind and put liability and their financial well being above their patients health?  Avoid you can find a better therapist who will spend more then 30 minutes with you.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This service is great if you don’t want to use insurance or be able to deal with anyone competent on back office things. I’ve never in my life had such a horrible customer service from a medical provider. Who says they take insurance but doesn’t have the ability to submit claims or answer questions? Something is very very off.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,Loved everything about the app but when I signed up it said 50 dollars plus the price of medication it said nothing else about a higher price then it said they took out 325 and when I went to talk to the customer service all they kept saying was that's the price.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"My first therapist had loud noises in the background during our first session, was very apathetic and would repeat in a very monotoned voice “I’m sorry that happened to you” while just typing on her computer. Then she just left after our second session and passed me off to some other therapist that completely blew off the session I scheduled with her.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Get help in other manners please. Maybe a new hobby. Cerebral does not take privacy and confidentiality into mind when you’re going through sessions. They also will not get you in as much for sessions as they claim. It’s a waste of money and time. The hour for therapy is only an hour for them to let you ramble on and then in the end of the session is when they tell you to reflect.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I would leave less than one star if I could. They offer an introductory rate and then schedule your appointment at the end of the first month so you don’t have time to cancel the crappy service. Any 5 star review you see on here is either and employee or a paid review. I hope this company folds and is sued for the scam that is,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,There is a multi step cancellation process that involves you emailing them and they emailing you back so if you try to cancel and you get the first email but don’t get the second you are still in enrolled. Please look somewhere else for an easier cancellation policy because they will take your money and not give it back.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Definitely DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. They do not continue services of you move, or travel for work, have it nowhere stated and are not willing to refund money because “I did use the service” the session was 45mins of explaining to me my options since they can not help me and they are not offering services in Maine. But it’s fair for them to keep my $259. It’s not as affordable as it’s claimed to be",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,If you have ADHD and live anywhere aside from Washington don’t bother using this they don’t make it transparent that there’s only one place where they can actually dispense controlled medication‘s for it. Once you sign up to you can’t get your refund a huge and they charge you a lot so don’t even bother signing up for the scam service if you were trying to look for that.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I paid for the service for two months . I decided I didn’t want the service anymore . They are still trying to charge my card .I would not recommend this app to no one . The are trying to steal for me . After I have contacted customer support and told them to cancel my subscription. Why are you guys still trying to charge my card. SCAM SCAM SCAM
PEOPLE BEWARE!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,Can only scroll down the page like a millimeter at a time before you have to wait for it to catch up. Extremely frustrating especially for someone who’s already kind of losing their mind. Fix this asap,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Just to be clear, the signup fee is non-refundable, even if you don’t use the service, for example because your find out that they don’t have counselors available who meet your criteria/schedule or they don’t take your insurance. So just for you to see the website/app, you are essentially paying a large fee. It’s quite unusual.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I’ve lapsed on my meds twice because the pharmacy is unable to contact the provider to refill my prescription.  Tried contacting the support team and no one responds for 48 hours.  Worst medical experience of my life.  Good luck trying to call customer service - there is none.  I’m sure they’ll be shut down by the AMA soon for their lack of professionalism.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,2 months in and I’ve spoken with one person. And she asked about mediation more than what I was looking for in therapy. No contact whatsoever after that. Now I’m a few days away from finally talking to someone and they cancel and need to reschedule. Looking at another 4 weeks. For what they charge monthly that is two months and they’ve done nothing. Lower than one star in my eyes.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,So far my appointments have been great my doc did prescribe me my medication and I was sent a text msg stating it’s on the way soon I click on it nothing is on its way so… and on top of that fees are definitely hidden you never really know how much you have to pay for anything untill your card is charged,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Can’t get a diagnosis even when stated up front multiple times. Provider was very rushed and it was obvious she was rushed. They prescribe medication WITHOUT a diagnosis. The $30 initial is just to get you in the door. After that it’s $325/month(NOT stated up front). No reason to use them unless you already have a diagnosis. All the ads and everything are total lies.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I had the worst time getting an appt with the provider through this app only to have one appt canceled the same day and the follow up appt canceled after the provider was already 15 minutes late (appt was 30 min). My medication was delayed an extra week due to this. This is awful for a company that claims to care about mental health.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This app is poorly designed in terms of billing and getting proper mental health help. For those simply looking to get medication just go to a primary care physician instead of paying $80 a month to meet with someone for 15 minutes. not worth the price and isn’t compatible with my insurances. It’s worth the wait to seek in person help,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This app preys on people who are desperate. I scheduled an appointment with my “care counselor” at a time within my availability. Without my knowledge or permission, they changed it on me and had the audacity to get upset with me because I couldn’t make it work as it was outside my availability. I’ve submitted a request to cancel but so far I haven’t seen any change in my account.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Weekly subscription is required. If you’re looking for care to start relatively soon, even within the same month of subscribing (and paying for) to this service, you will be disappointed to learn that there are little to no appointments for at least two months out.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Prescriber has canceled an appointment for the 3rd time in two days. They keep saying how it’s important to meet with the prescriber but if it’s so important, why do they keep canceling? Hopefully they refund my $30 for the first month because otherwise, I’m paying for a service I’m not receiving. Not to mention the increased anxiety that comes from the constant cancellations.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Got this app because I am desperate for help and all local counselors in my area were booked full. Once I chose my plan and payments were processed, I actually had a callback from a local therapist and decided I no longer needed this service.

Contacted their email for a refund. No response. Called their customer service line, no representative picked up or gave me a callback despite asking for one through their automated system.

I didn’t use a single service, no appointments, no video calls, no medications sent to my house; just $325 drained from my account I won’t get back.

Be careful using this app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I love the Cerebral service, but the iOS app leaves much to be desired. Doesn't remember my login. Doesn't support Face ID. Shows me a blank screen after attempting to log in, and instead I have to go to the create account page and then ""already have an account"" to log in instead. Just poorly executed and not up to professional standards.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’ve been locked out of this app due to a technical bug since they charged me over $200 a few weeks ago. I have no access to my prescription, care professionals, or therapy. They refuse to answer my emails and haven’t contacted me to even assist to give me access. I still have had no response - very disappointing for a self-care app. Beware.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,These guys are terrible all they care about is billing you. Can never get an appointment and they made it very difficult to cancel and kept charging my credit card. Plus if you order mail in prescriptions from them they will Jack up the price! Even for generic drugs. Look else where. Just a tech company cashing in on people’s mental health.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,Cerebral is great but the site has been having some glitches. I’m unable to login. It will log me in and say that I haven’t finishing intake and then tell theirs an error and kicks me out. This has been happening for over about a week so hoping they get it fixed soon or I’ll have to cancel.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Every time I scheduled my appointment with my therapist, she never shows up. It makes me think that she never really wants to talk to me about my problems at all. I always have to reschedule because she is not there. I want a therapist that is going to show to appointments not flake out on you. Worse app to use ever!!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"After a single meeting, 2 charges, and a month later and still nothing from anyone on my “care team”. Every attempt to message my counselor is met with nothing and every time I go to support they haven’t helped me. I suggest finding another provider worth your money and will actually help you",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They ask for your credit card before your insurance info. Feels like the toxic self serving medical culture, profiting off of anti-establishment ideals with nothing but corporate driven goals. I am already paying several hundred for my insurance. Not gonna pay you only to have to pursue my own reimbursement. This is stuff is over hyped based on trendy marketing and annoying influencers.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This app is a scam. It’s wayyy more money than they make it sound and for less time then you think. I’ve never had people TRY to confuse me so much with prices and plans. Just get better help or something. This is awful. If you want to cancel your plan you have to go through all this garbage just to try to cancel it. Super slimy app, don’t get it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"You get what you pay for with cerebral, if you think a massive out of network, non refundable fee is worth it for the same services any psychiatrist can provide on zoom for much less money. I have never been so let down by any mental health service. It’s all veneer folks, there is no real substance here just flashy marketing and a garbage, overpriced service",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Very deceptive tactics utilized to get folks to sign up and subscribe only to find out appointment availability is a month away.

Support is slow and nearly useless. I had such high hopes for this service only to have them blown away. Asked for a refund but they refused, even though they did a whole bait and switch. 

Bank contacted, chargeback filed. Save your time and money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,Canceled my subscription after a few weeks. Poor response times from their providers.  They changed my care counselor without consulting me. My prescriber was late to our meeting.  The medication came in a timely fashion but getting the actual counseling seemed impossible.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Refuse to honor my cancellation on an account that had no services provided. They will give you a runaround saying there is a cancel bottle in the app or web app there is not. I sent screenshots. I never used any services provided by them so can’t speak of the providers, but if their customer support is bad it gives me a bad taste for the rest of their practices.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Customer for two months, cancelling service. My prescriber sent the wrong prescription initially. I had to wait weeks to get an appointment with her just to correct it, then she was a no-show.🤬 Customer support is not empowered to help in any meaningful capacity - they don’t directly answer your questions and I’ve been sent in circles. So frustrating and unhelpful.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This service is awful I signed up and found out I wasn’t able to see anyone for over a month after I already paid for the service so I canceled because obviously I needed to see someone sooner and they refused to give me a refund even though I never actually used their services.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Every single time I tried to communicate with someone there's was some sort of a challenge that would make it borderline torturing. Broken links for the appointments? No way to schedule a session cause everything is magically booked for over a month? Ignored messages? Got all that.

But I sincerely hope that I'm the only person facing such issues.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I was given a psychiatrist and she was sipping pepsi the entire session and answered a phone call from her son during the session. I contacted support to switch my provider and they barely answered my messages and never switched me so i just stopped going and got my account deactivated. as someone who really needed the professional help this is discouraging,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They had me pay for the full month of care before being able to confirm an appointment, and now that I’m trying to schedule one, there aren’t any available for an entire month. Keeps giving me a ‘sorry, this was “just” booked’ message.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I cancelled my membership with them a month ago and they still proceeded to charge me! I filled out their form to cancel 3 times and they still proceeded to charge my card this month!! I am absolutely annoyed because I can’t afford this service anymore so now my card is in the negative because of this!!! Unbelievable.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I was part of this program for two weeks. They gave me the wrong medication that made my symptoms worse and during a session they tried to upsell me to buy more visits when I was trying to talk about painful topics. They wasted 20 minutes going over more plans and trying to pull more money out of me.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They will sign you up under misleading information, cancel your account the same day at your request when you then realize everything they didn’t tell you in the Instagram ad, and refuse to refund you the $30 you paid to find out that it would actually cost you upwards of $300 and not the $85 they suggested. STAY AWAY.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,You can’t call anyone to talk to a real person. They want you to do everything through their messaging system but their own “care coordinators” don’t respond for DAYS. Truly infuriating and unrealistic of a real physical psychiatrist office. I can’t even leave a voice mail to get a call back what a joke.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,I had to remind my prescriber on two occasions. This month my medication was out of stock in our area and my prescriber was not able to help me with an alternative medicine. This service should provide more flexibility not less…I’m going back to my traditional prescriber.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I signed in to be able to find out how much this would cost. I thought that I may have some insurance coverage and found out I did not I was signed up for less than  48 hours before I askedCancel my subscription. Which required filling out forms etc. They refunded me less than 10% of what I paid and rendered me zero service.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I don’t understand how this company is legal.  They do not give you the service you pay for and do not care about your mental health.  This company will ignore you and do whatever they can to exacerbate your mental health issues so you want to give up. Find a therapist and psychiatrist who cares. 

Please think very hard before wasting your time and money with Cerebral.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I canceled my subscription and filled out the cancellation form and I was still charged for the month. For being a mental health app, I don’t think an app has ever frustrated me as much as Cerebral. The customer service is terrible, I was switched counselors/providers reassigned multiple times, and had my sessions canceled or rescheduled several times. I want a full refund.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They make it so easy the first time you choose, and if it’s not a good fit, the process for finding another provider or counselor is ridiculous.  It’s not efficient at all, and you can only change anything or ask for help by email or phone.  Not cool.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I used cerebral in hopes that they could refill my medicine as it can get very busy for me to see my doctor. After I paid my $30, I was then told they cannot fill it due to them not having the proper license. I asked for a refund as the visit with the nurse practitioner only lasted 1 minute, but have not heard anything in return.

Would not recommend",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Customer service is lackluster. Sign up carefully. They blame you for trying to get help. Prescriber missed visit. Very difficult to get answers. There are service choices but prescribers mainly want to look for medication choices for you. If this does not apply you get to start over with someone else.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Do not use this service at all! They do not help with anxiety or ADHD like the site says especially if you are already on a controlled substance that was prescribed by an actual doctor you see in person. They prescribed me a medication that counteracted the depression meds I am on and made it worse. You cannot get ahold of anybody either.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY.

I canceled on February 9th. I filled out all required paperwork. After signing up AND PAYING I was told I was ineligible due to family history with heart conditions and the pop up box said I would receive a full refund, which has STILL not happened. Not only have I not received a refund, but they have not discontinued my account at all.

There is absolutely NO customer support. If you call to ask someone, you’re told to email. If you email you receive a cookie cutter robot response.

Absolutely TERRIBLE performance from a company that is supposed to be dealing with mental health.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,First off when I did their little survey and checked off that I think about hurting myself and would rather be dead almost every day they diagnosed me with “no depression” and “no anxiety” but maxed out ADHD. Then they don’t even let you confirm if your insurance with work. They just want to know how you’ll be paying them first,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I need help with severe, debilitating ADHD. I'm seeking medication after a lifetime of trying everything else. After downloading the app, right away you're asked to select your struggle from a list of four things-- Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar, and I believe the fourth was Eating Disorder but I'm not sure. I am sure that ADD/ADHD was not on the list.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Cerebral put me on medication and then told me to quit cold turkey. I tried to cancel my services but they would not let me until I filled out a form. They are cutting it close to my next charge so I’m charged for the next month without receiving care that I need. Cerebral takes advantage of mentally unwell people and just want your money.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,First few appointments will be prompt. Then you will have to pull teeth to get any kind of response. Prescription written incorrectly and not trusted by most pharmacies apparently. Not a cheap service and definitely not a service worth what they are charging. They will charge you after your accounts canceled and will refuse a refund. Had to order a new debit card.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This app is so bad. I’ve tried everything to get it to work. I can’t log in on my phone because a white screen comes up and I can’t do anything. I’ve done everything I know to try to fix the problem and it keeps happening. I had to delete the app and just use my web browser.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The prescriber hung up on me. I asked for a new one 3 weeks later they assigned me a new prescriber who had no open appointments for 2 years. It literally does nothing, they just take your money I spoke to one person for maybe 20 minutes in 2 months. Don’t pay for this they will not give you your money back either.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Worst experience I’ve ever had, these people say that they are all about customer service Well that’s a lie trying to get our money back two weeks now they don’t care about you it’s no wonder employees left and started making complaints about this company I gave him one star for the effort on how cunning they are",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"the service and actual care team and doctors are amazing. however the app only works half of the time, if that. i have missed appointments due to not getting alerts (and i do have alerts on for the app. i checked), missed important messages and updates from my care team, and i am never able to see my appointments because when i click on the appointments button it just gives me a blank white screen. these issues are affecting peoples treatment. please fix your app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They take forever to reach out, and the app doesn’t have a button on the appointment page to schedule an appointment. So in case you have an issue with medication, good luck getting that fixed in a timely manner. I’ll be going to betterhelp in hopes they actually care about their patients.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This is not a replacement for anything. The app has barely worked. I’ve had to email support for individual links to set appointments. I did not get a choice for counselors. I don’t feel right supporting a company that is so clearly misleading an audience of folks who need real help. They should be ashamed of themselves.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Was look for a therapist but since they don’t take insurance I am not going to go through the hassle of sending an invoice to insurance every time to get reimbursed. Kind of defeats the purpose of having insurance. I have in the past had to do that and was such a big mess and confusion. Not willing to go through such a headache again.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"After paying I was not able to complete the onboarding process due to an error in their online scheduling system. I was never able to access any of the subscription services. I reached out to Cerebral’s support and requested a refund. I was issued a fraction of the money I paid, citing their terms and conditions. Feels fraudulent to me.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’ve used a variety of services such as in-person, LiveHealth, Done, BetterHelp. This is by far the worst one yet. The onboarding is completely broken, as is half of the app. Once you register you’ll be bombarded by emails. Customer service is outsourced to a company that has no knowledge of how to help. Don’t waste your time here.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up and it doesn’t let you check if they take your insurance until after you’ve paid and signed up. Turns out they don’t take my insurance so not Im broke and I will have to cancel my subscription after the first visit since I can’t afford it without insurance, giant waist of my time and money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Takes a long time to get help when you need it.  I’ve been having a convo with my “ care coordinator for 3 days because she only responds every 24-36 hours.  Trying to straighten out a prescription.  Not as great as I thought it would be. Kinda expensive for no reason. They d*** sure took my money right away though.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,If you have family history of heart disease you can’t use this service. But they don’t tell you that until after you submit payment. How about you include that WAY before you ask for payment… I do not recommend this app…,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I used cerebral for several months and constantly had my provider changed on me, appointments cancelled last minute, and providers only available a few months out. There was a ton of provider turnover which makes me think they are terrible to employees too.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was prescribed two medications without any follow up or support and was ghosted by 2 prescribers and no ability to get a response as to why my appointments were missed and my inability to speak with a professional. Only response received was in regards to continuing my subscription to cerebral. Do not use this platform. Dangerous, unprofessional, and irresponsible.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I have a severe mental illness and in my mania i signed up with them. After finding someone local i decided to cancel my membership and they never refunded the money i paid them for one months service. They gaslighted me on my refund. I still haven’t gotten it yet. Stay away from them.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I tried it out and all I can say is this: if you use your insurance, ASK prior to your first consult what level of care you are going to receive. My app said one level whereas after my a few messages between them and myself determined I had another. Other than that it was an okay experience.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I’m in my fifties and have adhd. Cerebral offered a significant discount for the first month so I signed up. You have to make a prescriber appointment with one of their prescribers. I couldn’t get an appointment for almost 2 months. It’s a monthly subscription. No refund available. So I paid just to sign up and get absolutely zero from them.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This is a complete scam!! The cancelled my appointments and still tried to charge me for the services which I did not receive! Don’t waste your time or your money these are not professional people. The coordinator Charolett would not work with me and told me I signed up I knew the fee, even though they did not keep their appointments!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I forgot my password and the change password was glitching after a month I finally got back into my account but I have had several charges they make it hard to cancel their subscription and I’m just upset with the amount of money they’ve taken from me,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Limited availability for appointments. Customer service is quick but do not actually solve your issue. Cancellation has been pending for almost a month. You almost have to try hard to be that slow. I emailed reviews@cerebral and no one responded.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"So once you sign up there is a $30 promo charge for the first month — in my case I could not verify my ID so I was forced to cancel. Unbelievably, Cerebral support refused to refund that $30 even though I had just signed up and never once spoke to anyone. It’s meant to help people, but in the end it can come off as a bit of a scam.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’ve tried everything to get the app to work but nothing works. I’ve tried rescheduling appointments—doesn’t work. My therapist was a no show so I emailed support—because the app doesn’t work—and still haven’t received an answer. Even though my NP is fantastic, I still wouldn’t recommend this service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They have extreme limitations when it comes to medications. This was quoted in their website

“We often start with non-controlled treatment options. If this is not sufficient for the individual, then our prescribers will consider the addition of other medications.”
This is completely false and they are not able to prescribe even mild sedatives for anxiety.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Set an initial appointment with a provider and she did not show up. Requested to be scheduled with a different provider and I was told no. They rescheduled me with the same provider and she did not show up AGAIN so I have canceled my service and hopefully they will issue me a refund. Disappointing experience.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I canceled this subscription before I even had my first appointment. It was weeks out. I found a local clinic and have emailed, chatted with people on the app, canceled the app. Gone back and forth and they still take $85 out of my account every month. 5 months now. Horrible service. Nothing. And I’m out $425 for absolutely nothing.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I loved my therapist but had to cancel because the medication and therapist plan was crazy expensive. I canceled and they deactivated my account so I was not able to schedule anymore appointments even tho they charged me for the month. They will refuse to give me a refund. Extremely disappointed.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Support from “perscribers” was lackluster. I got rid of my account 4 months ago. Charged me for a month after I deleted my account. Turns out they keep your card on file even after your account is supposedly deleted. Decided to charge me another $30 from 4 months ago. Avoid.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’ve sent multiple emails and called customer support, but I haven’t been able to cancel my subscription. I did not have a good experience regarding care on this app. Please, avoid this service at all costs or you will be charged for more than you signed up for.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Look at at what they collect from you and share your sensitive data with third party advertisers! Good things I didn’t create an account because you had a click a button to share your info with advertisers before you could even create an account!!! Beware!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This is 100 percent a scam. I tried this and every month they took my money, I had to reschedule My appointments over and over cause they never showed up to the appointments. I tried using the coordinators for help I was just talking to myself three months in still no response. Same your money and get a real doctor this is a scam.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I provided screenshots and emails showing I cancelled.  They continue to charge me and will not respond regarding a refund.  They took money out after cancellation and refuse to acknowledge it.  Reading the reviews, I am not the only one that they have stolen from and created stress and financial hardship towards.  They don’t help.  They prey on the vulnerable.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I am disabled due to the murder of my three year old twin daughters and I get $670/mo. My psychiatrist of 30 years just retired and I was desperately trying to find help after calling every place I could think of for my mental health and I should’ve read the last few reviews or I would never have subscribed. Never. Robbery so far.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They charge you before you can look at available therapists and even if their are none with availability you can't get more than a 30% refund. 

I'm also not interested in ""updating"" my review until this policy is changed .",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They are ok if you need basic medicine but if you really have anxiety, they will not help. Please see a real doctor if you have serious problems. I was offered Benadryl for anxiety. It’s like they didn’t care at all That I can’t hardly leave the house or have a life outside of my room. We need better Doctors online.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This seems like homework without any support. It’s like the worst part of the pandemic. You’re paying for the minimum support. It’s a bunch of links and app use without the actual support of people. The cost for that kind of care seems like a scam.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This is an awful, uncaring platform for mental healthcare. I now have no mental healthcare and no option of finding anything else where I live. Can’t imagine how many people have already hurt themselves using it and how many more will die until they get shut down.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’m a member now and would love to utilize the app and it’s feature, but when I enter my login information it goes to a blank white screen every time. Support emailed me back and all they said was “use it on your computer instead” basically. How frustrating 😭",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Seriously save  your money and go see someone in person, because that’s what there going to end up telling you to do anyway, so I paid 130 dollars to be told to see someone in person. Cancelling is a really difficult. Waste of time , waste of money. These apps should be shutdown!!!!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"At first they are very attentive, but then so they say they will prescribe you some thing and then prescribe you something totally different , without explanation ..basically impossible to get in touch with someoneSlow response still waiting to hear backTo see if they will fix my problem or refund me",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"At first this was great and very convenient. However, after 2 appointments there was no availability for follow up appointments which are required to keep receiving the medication. Although advised not to stop the medication cold turkey, I had no choice. I contacted support and received no help. Not only is this a waste of money, but bad for my health. BEWARE.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Spent 3 mins on the phone with some NP and she’s ready to diagnose and prescribe me mind altering medications? No. Hard pass. This app will end up convincing people they have disorders they don’t have all because this scammy company wants you hooked on pills for profit. This business is deeply unethical and it’s no surprise DOJ is investigating them. RUN AWAY FAST.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Worst app I’ve ever used . After 4 days of use they said they could no longer help me after already prescribing me medication for my bipolar disorder and then refused to refund me afterwards bc I “already spoke with the prescriber” for literally 15 minutes . Do not use this app if you are actually looking for help with mental health .,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,The company is preying on the mentally ill. I was prescribed a heavy anti depressant after a 20 minute conversation with a stranger. Never followed up. It's impossible to get an appointment after you meet with your prescriber the first time. They do not update the app with your current prescriptions. I assume the company with be shut down within a couple years.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Literally spent an hour and a half waiting for my prescription in my pharmacy for medication for my ADHD and they denied me saying because it was a controlled substance and needed more information from Doctor. Which the doctor who diagnosed me 12 years ago I cant even get a hold of it. Complete waste of money and time.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This app is a scam. They charge $99 up front all the while knowing they have no therapists or times available. Then they refuse to grant a refund when you have no choice but to cancel. Do not let them take advantage of you - they are looking to steal money from people searching for affordable care.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have never seen such inadequate care. I have run out of medication a couple of times without the providers refilling them on time. The care team apologizes for a “technical glitch” that was present for 2.5 months that did not allow me to communicate with them. Nothing, but neglectful!!!!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They take a week to do what should take a few minutes.

I don’t know how things are run on the back end but it seems like a a lot of people doing nothing. Probably should've read these reviews before signing up 

Hopefully I can get my meds this week",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,My initial appointment was fine and I set up a check in for 2 weeks after since I was discontinuing some medication per the providers recommendation. My provider no showed my 2nd appt and now has no availability for the next 2 months. This is not good patient care.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up for their basic plan, and right in the middle of my assessment it says i have to choose a plan and pay all over again. Like if i never filled anything out. The app suffered memory loss and took my money making me stress out about money even more. Do not recommend.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,If you want to talk to a random doctor or counselor every time this is the app for you ! No one ever gets back to you in a timely manner. It’s on the verge of being cruel. I don’t recommend this service for anyone looking for mental help. It’s definitely cause more harm then good. Terrible service and experience,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Charge you for the first month but even in a major metro area they have no appointments for at least a month out. When I canceled (immediately) I was told no refund would be authorized. Can’t stand being charged for a service I haven’t even received. Would not recommend.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Don’t waste your time on this app, save yourself $30. After they gather your information and your payment method, the app stops working. Sad you guys are targeting people who are looking for help with mental health. You guys are the worst",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have tried and tried again to log into my account through the app but every time I do it just goes to a blank white screen. I couldn’t schedule any of my appointments, luckily support was able to help me schedule them but did not acknowledge the broken app",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,These people should not call themselves mental health professionals. If anything this service exacerbated my mental health issues.. I am honestly at a loss for words at how absolutely horrible I was treated for literally no reason? Was it negligence or just a blatant disregard for my well being? Either way. 100 percent do NOT recommend them..,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Every time I go to view password while entering or try to log in, I get a blank white screen. I can just use the web browser but it's seriously frustrating I can't just use the app :/",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I tried getting services via my insurance - which unfortunately did not cover - so I was gonna look elsewhere. Although I received no services or used the app they charged me and offered me 30% refund of the charge. Don’t do it  .. it’s all about the money for them.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up and was unable to get a provider or councilor for over a month. So I have to pay for a month just to pay for one more BEFORE I can even meet with someone? Talk about giving me anxiety, yikes, not good for a service that’s supposed to be here helping. I highly recommend staying away!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Everything they have you can find free online. I had a scheduled visit with a doctor and the doctor never showed up. I had the app for 3 days, never talked to a doctor and didn’t get anything. They refused to give a refund. Also not cheap-$85 a month is expensive. I don’t recommend this app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Pricing is not clear and trying to cancel is multiple steps. I tried to cancel but couldn’t Figure out how at first but tried changing my plan to only therapy. I was instantly charged $174 and they refuse to refund my money even though I hadn’t used any service!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Do not sign up for this app if you want to be hundreds out for absolutely nothing. I canceled after being mislead by their deceitful marketing practices about therapy and when attempting to get a refund, I was told the money did not ‘push through’ into my bank account. It’s been a month now and nada yet.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,You get a little upfront dialogue as they swipe your credit card however the only way to communicate with their staff (anyone with a heartbeat) afterwards is via email and chat with 24 hour beyond response times.  This is a scam,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I could never get past the login screen. I would put in my credentials and then the screen would just turn white and nothing would happen. I could only ever login in online, not with the app. Otherwise, Cerebral is a great company with great service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"I have Borderline Personality Disorder and ADHD. Their website/app is faulty and has issues, their doctors are unprofessional and don’t get back to you and you have to fill out a form in order to cancel and wait days for them to stop trying to charge you. Never got help, total waste of money",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They will not treat you as a patient, instead they will give you whatever drugs you ask for as long as you pay. They make it incredibly hard to leave the service and will milk you for as much money as they can. Classic drug dealers.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"I downloaded this app in hopes of getting counseling for my anxiety. My first visit was with a doctor and was told it was extra money to get counseling therapy.

1,"If you’re serious about therapy, this isn’t the place to come. I was told there were 3 therapists I could choose from in my state. I tried 2 both not great for me. The first being highly inappropriate. When I asked for a refund they turned me down. Very disappointed.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Be warned, they do not care about your mental health and only want your money. They would rather worsen your mental health symptoms than refund for a service thats never used. If you cancel a day too late, that’s too bad. You’re stuck paying for the entire month.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"There was only one provider available in my area and when they left the company they had no alternative.

I never received counseling because the only provider left the company and I was still charged for the month.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"I tried to make an account only to find they wouldn’t let me add my insurance (which is valid in my state for this service.) when i contacted customer service, they said they weren’t doing therapy right now. How on earth is a therapy app not doing therapy? Only medications, though. Very counterproductive.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Do not download this app or fall for their scams. They will take your money and run, even if you try and cancel right away. Kyle Robertson, the CEO has been in trouble in the past and has been found guilty of predatory practices before. 
This company needs to be exposed, and Kyle Robertson needs to be put behind bars, again!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,They will charge you crazy amounts of money and render no services!  Be very careful if you choose to work with them!  Customer service is really bad and I can’t stress enough how displeased I was with being billed $300 when I didn’t even use the service!,cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"Signed up for this today.

No available prescriber for over 3 months. So I can’t even START a prescription. 

No Care councilor available at all. Like, never. 

So I am recovering NO services at all. But I’ve already paid for this month because they take it out immediately, without providing ANY of the things they claim. Now I get the joy of attempting a refund, which I read they screw you on too. If it is all not refunded and cancelled properly, I will do a charge back on my account and change my debit card.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have adhd and have been diagnosed for years. The symptoms are overlapping with no polar and the questions they ask are very vague. I don’t feel manic or depressed but according to them I Amanda also no polar. That doctor was a joke. Sounds like they are selling me drugs they get paid to sell, not trying to help my ADHD.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,sounds like others are going through the same thing i am with cerebral. I cant get them to get in touch with the doctor to fill my medicine. I am having horrible withdrawals. I put in a request to refill my rx 5 days ago.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Be very careful to look over the fine print with these guys. They’ll take more of your money than you’re expecting and refuse to offer any sort of refund whether or not you actually use any of their services. Very predatory behavior for a mental health app.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I’ve already paid for services and they won’t let me log in without “finishing onboarding” which I’ve tried to do and it won’t let me get past the scheduling part and so basically it’s worthless because I can’t even log into app.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They suspended my account 2 days before my first appointment for payment revision, but I was charged for another 2 months of services I didn’t receive.

2,They will not cancel unless you jump through their hoops. They have a phone number but they can’t do anything for you over the phone.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They make it really hard to cancel and then refuse to refund your money. It’s terrible and for those suffering mental health issues, make everything worse! I want to jump off the roof as they’ve robbed me of nearly $200. If I wasn’t ill before, I certainly am now. And it’s all their fault!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"They don’t employ actual psychiatrists, only psych RN’s, so if you actually need scheduled meds, you’re out of luck.

Also, getting an appointment with your assigned prescriber is like pulling teeth, and they will often cancel your appointments without notice.

I have been waiting for over a month to speak with my prescriber, and they keep cancelling my appointments, regardless of the fact that I’ve been without my meds this whole time.

Go find an actual psychiatrist you can speak to face to face, this is a scam, at best.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I did this service for a few months. They seem to be big on pushing medication. The council care is mediocre, and they charge a lot for medication that doesn’t get delivered. This service is pretty bad. Watch for hidden fees as well.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"They prescribe medications that you can’t just quit, and then don’t follow up for refills. They 
“Counselors” do not listen at all. They just figure out a medication to put you on and if you have issues or side effects you’re on your own. Stay away from them.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"A cash grab poor excuse for real care. Don’t waste your time or money. 
UPDATE: quit playing with these fools when they won’t cancel your membership and contact your state Attorney General and Dept of Public Health. When their prescribers get sanctioned in their state issuing their license they’ll listen to you",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Beware that you give a good deal of personal information before you ever get to the app. Believing I could use insurance I actually gave them my legitimate information. I emailed asking my data be deleted, response I got was ""you want to unsubscribe to emails?""",cerebral-mental-health,,,

Super disappointed, waste of time! 
Even changed my whole schedule around to make the time for this. 
Hope this helps other, and did nothing for me since no one even showed up!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This app is a scam. Two counselors canceled because they left the company. New appointments are weeks away and it strings you along past the introduction to continue charging. There is no cancellation in app and you have to send an email. Over a month and not a single service rendered.  Absolute trash.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,They don’t tell you until after you pay that they can’t treat all patients and then they refuse to refund your money even if they can’t treat you!! Should have know that his was not legit after being spammmed with emails about a SALE everyday before I signed up.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,They won’t give you a refund if they feel they can’t treat you but will still tell you that you can message or have therapy therefore you do not get a refund if you want to cancel because of that and want your money back,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,After logging in my screen goes white and I am able to do nothing using the app. Makes it really inconvenient to have to use safari on my phone or laptop every time instead of the app.,cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,Unskilled therapists who apparently are allowed to do sessions while their kids are screaming in the background.  Switching counselors without reason.  Having to wait weeks for an appointment.  The chat function is great unless you need to talk to someone within 8 hours lol.  ABSOLUTE TRASH COMPANY.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Do not get this app. In order to cancel you have to email them but they are completely unresponsive and won’t answer for days and still charge you even though it says they will answer within a couple hours!! This app is a scam!!!!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,This company is a racket not a rehabilitation. They’re only here for your money and will prescribe you anything they please and suddenly stop for no reason at all. I can safely say this is in the top 3 worst companies I’ve ever made the mistake of doing business with.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Totally counterproductive mental help company. Agents have zero initiative, are not clear on what’s needed and the only action I see is when I reach out. I’ve had this a month and have nothing but regrets. This has done more to mess with my head than anything else.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"I signed up and cancelled less than 24 hours later when I realized how much the future months would be, and you all refused to refund my $130 I literally spent on nothing.

1,My appointments were rescheduled last minute with nothing available for weeks! Yet they charged me $85 for the monthly fee and never helped me get access to care! Refused to refund me the fees.

1,They are the absolute worst. A person could have serious adverse reactions waiting for an appointment or a message back from them. And the pricing is ridiculous. Charged my insurance on top of charging me for service?,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Appointments mean nothing, I have had on 3 separate occasions had a persciber not show for their appointments which has lead me into going to the hospital twice on top of the 350 I’m being charged by this app. Support is a joke and your refills will not be on time.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

trust me, find a different way to get your meds. this ain’t it",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Don’t waste your time. You’ll end up waiting just as long as a local provider but have to pay for the months no appointments are available. Customer service was condescending and rude about it as well,cerebral-mental-health,,,

2,"I got Cerebral and had one appointment with a provider. She was nice but I didn’t feel like the platform worked for me and in-person was the care I needed. I sent out an email to Cerebral explaining this and saying I’d like to cancel afterwards. (you have to email them to cancel your account). Almost two 2 months after this, Cerebral took $85 out of my account. Apparently you have a to fill out a follow up form after saying you’d like to cancel, or else your account isn’t actually cancelled. I missed this, which is my fault. Immediately after seeing the charge I emailed Cerebral and explained the situation, and while understand this was an error on my end, I told them that that money was supposed to be for bills and I really needed it. I asked if they could at least give me a partial refund since I only used one service months ago and haven’t used anything since. They basically said “nope sorry we have it now!” And that’s the problem with these companies. While I’m sure Cerebral employs some wonderful providers that will help you, Cerebral itself is still a company and their care for your mental health ends where their wallet begins. I’m sure being late on my bills will do wonders for my mental health. If you’re worried about money at all, I would highly recommend just getting in touch with some local providers. Most therapists do telehealth visits now and are willing to work with you on copays and payment plans. They certainly won’t charge you almost $100 two months after you stop seeing them and say “sorry, my money now!” When you’re dealing with Cerebral, you’re dealing with a business who’s bottom line is to make money, not care about your mental health. Just keep that in mind!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Absolute scam! DO NOT TRY IT!! 
They take your money and say they can’t issue you a refund. There are also no therapist available!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"My care counselor was really nice. That is the end of anything positive I have to say. I spent 4 months with Cerebral and that is as many months as I now behind in getting treatment. After joining, it was almost a month until I could meet with a prescriber. (You know the whole thing they advertise against.) During my first session, my prescriber spoke with me for 15 minutes and prescribed a generic catch-all medication. Admittedly, I was actually alarmed by how much of a standard thing that seemed. There was no consideration of my medical history or my individual symptoms. After 6 weeks without improvement, my second appointment was a 10 minute follow up, where just as quickly, that medication was dropped and a new one was prescribed. I was told if that didn’t work, we would try a more traditional ADHD treatment. A follow up was set for 4 weeks. Within the first, I became depressive and borderline suicidal. I have never suffered from depression until that medication. When I finally got my follow up and informed him of my response to the medication I was told sorry, and that there was “nothing more they could do for me.” After nearly 4 months, I was right back to where I had started. For counseling, I was allowed one 30 minute session each month. While not entirely unhelpful (my counselor is the only reason for a second star), 30 minutes a month is simply not ample to actually address serious issues. I have wasted time, wasted money, and wasted potential opportunities for growth. Cerebral is nothing more than a quick-cash pyramid scheme. There is just something not quite right under the exterior, and I would imagine the current DOJ and DEA investigations will not be the last into Cerebral. Please learn from my mistake. The wait for a real mental health professional is well, well worth it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"I signed up thinking this would be a great and convenient way to get connected with a new therapist. Unfortunately my experience has been the exact opposite. There was only about 4 therapist to choose from. Based on profiles I did not think anywhere a good match but I thought I’d get outside my comfort zone and pick one that I could see myself comfortable with. Within 24 hours qof our first scheduled meeting, that therapist had quit. Leaving me now with only 2 therapist to choose from to schedule a new appointment over a week away. That provider then also ended up canceling appointments. I had reached out on the chat within the app requesting to cancel and it apparently went to the therapist not the coordinator and all she said back was a letter (I don’t remember but it was like “w”). Which was not helpful in getting this subscription cancelled and refunded. I reached out to support requesting to cancel and a refund due to their lack of providers and never successfully getting on an appointment. This has been a nightmare as well. Only offering about 75% of the most recent payment, not both payment withdrawn in full. Currently waiting on the 2nd support person I’ve spoken with over the last week to connect me with a manager since support is not able to do anything about this matter. Now if service was used I would definitely be understanding to why they cannot issue a full refund. But it’s disappointing how awful this experience has been because this world needs easier access and affordable access to therapist. Cerebral is a long way from it. 

Hoping this review helps others in finding a therapist they feel comfortable with without feeling ripped off like I have with this service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This app is absolutely horrendous. The sign up was easy enough. You send them your insurance info and the app will say if you’re covered or not. Mine said I was covered, so needless to say I signed up. 3 months into the treatment, absolutely zero improvement. They gave me a month worth of subscription pills that’s more suitable for depression or cigarettes addiction, than ADHD. You have to wait a whole month before you can change your drugs. After signing up, you would have to wait until whenever the prescriber is ready in order to make an appointment with them, so you basically paid $30 while not getting the service you paid for for at least 4 days to a week. I got so done with this service so I cancelled. Unfortunately, the horrible experience only starts here. When I cancelled, the customer rep said my account is terminated. But I can still sign in. I didn’t take notice of this, until my on file card got charged $19 3 times out of no where. Called them and they said it’s a system error, so they refunded me. No biggie. Then a few weeks later, they suddenly charge me again for $30? I called them and they said my account is still in service because the termination process got messed up by an error, so they refunded me and said my card was removed from their system so I won’t get charged again. That’s was a few months ago. Today, they sent me an email I’ll be charged money for deductibles fees, while they have not disclose this at all during sign up, nor did they even mention it when they check my insurance info. Needless to say, I will not return to this app, nor will I recommend it. Heck, I’d recommend stay as far away from this app if you want your mental health to be better. 

TL;DR: horrible app, horrible experience.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,They just want your money they DO NOT WANT TO HELP YOU! Awful app awful customer service don’t do it,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"My experience with Cerebral was great, until it wasn’t. I was making good progress until I was abruptly reassigned to a new provider. I started over with them, and things went well, until once again, I was inexplicably reassigned. I only had one appointment with this new provider before I was once AGAIN reassigned. I’m sick of having to go over everything with a new person every single time, just to get a refill for a medication I’ve been successfully on for the past four+ years now. Also, keep in mind that when you tell them you want to cancel your plan, they immediately suspend any refills for your medication. Meaning, even if you have 1 or 2 refills left that you could otherwise get from the pharmacy, they essentially revoke authorization so you’re unable to get your meds. Absolutely irresponsible and a sorry excuse for “healthcare”. I’ve had to pay for an extra month I didn’t want with this service just to allow myself time to find another provider without lapsing on my meds. Going off of psychiatric medication cold turkey is, at best, extremely unpleasant, not to mention dangerous! For a service that claims to care about its patients, you sure do abandon that quickly once they decide to stop paying you. I wouldn’t wish medication withdrawal on my worst enemy, and you should be ashamed that you essentially hold this over people’s heads just to get them to stay with your service. No wonder so many providers are “moving on from Cerebral”. Also, why even offer an option for insurance if you’re not even going to take it? I had two different insurance plans while I was with Cerebral, and neither one was accepted despite being large, nationwide companies. The tens of dollars a month I might be saving versus my copay for an in-person appointment is nowhere near the headache and frustration this service has put me through. Plenty of doctors are offering telemedicine services; see someone locally instead. It might cost a little more, but you’ll at least have a better idea of what you’re getting yourself into.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"If you have finally mustered up the courage to seek help for your depression and anxiety, then you'll be happy to know that Cerebral is incredibly good at making everything worse!  I've struggled for years, and I was really proud of signing up for Cerebral, because I thought it was a big step for me, but I might as well have just flushed the money down the toilet.  Their system doesn't work, their prescriber and ""care"" team certainly doesn't care, they have non-existent support, they literally leave you to do and figure everything out for yourself.  Right out of the gate I had an issue with my prescriptions, and I couldn't get in contact with a single person for HOURS.  The first response I get is how they have up to 24 hours to respond to requests - right, that's my bad, I'll try to not have issues getting my anti-anxiety and depression medication filled for the very first time.  The cherry on top is that I tried to cancel the first time, and they said I had to email a cancel line (this is a stupid and predatory customer solutions tactic) and I didn't get a response.  Then when they finally added the functionality to their TERRIBLE app, I cancelled on the app (after they charged me that $85 bucks they certainly love) - the only problem is, right after I cancelled (after already paying) they cut off my access to my account AND to the app.  I couldn't access anything at all, and I had JUST paid for a new month just 3 days prior (confirmed to me by their idiotic support line).  Please do yourself a favor and find help from a source that actually wants to help you - I wish I had a better experience seeking help for the first time.  I literally wrote this to hopefully catch someone's eye when they need it, and you reading this, yeah you - go get help from someone not on the internet.  Call a doctor's office tomorrow and say that you are looking for resources for people to talk to about anxiety and depression.  There are people who WANT to help you.  Cerebral, you're awful - I cannot wait to see you crumble.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"🚨🚨🚨👎👎👎Cerebral did more harm than good to my mental health. They actually didn’t do any good. They will do the same to your mental health. This is a company that is selling mental wellness as a lifestyle, this is not a company trying to benefit your mental health. 🚨 Major red flags🚨: You can NOT cancel your paid membership on your own. You need to email them and wait 24-48 hours for a reply telling you to wait for confirmation that they received your request… yes, it’s that bad. While waiting for that confirmation they will begin spamming your inbox with requests for feedback. Feedback? You have literally done nothing except charge me. After you receive the coveted confirmation email they will say to wait for 24-48 for your membership to be cancelled. At some point they will cancel it. You might be charged for another month while waiting for the cancellation. It did not happen to me but a quick internet search will provide reviews from people who did suffer in that way. 🚨🚨 After all is said and done they will not delete your information and it will sit in their system for 6 years(for them to sell). They did nothing for me except charge my credit card and refused to delete my personal information. They will attempt to tell you they don’t sell your information but I have started receiving emails for other mental health services. Coincidence? Absolutely not. Stay away from Cerebral if you value your mental health. See a real professional in person. It might cost more but you will be better off for it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I personally had a very bad experience with this app.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I only had two appointments on this platform and they were pretty okay. They prescribed me a drug that actually increased my anxiety and it’s main side effect was increasing suicidal thoughts, did that too which was not fun. Very bad prescription for someone like me, wasn’t even made for anxiety and it worsened my symptoms. Besides that, they don’t really listen. They’ve been staring at computer screens all day so you’re not much besides another number to them and a check off their list. The customer service was really were I couldn’t handle it anymore. In the app there’s a customer service button, but it’s a dead link…. I don’t know if I was the only one this did that to but no matter what I did it neveerrrr worked! I tried finding contact info online because I wanted to include my insurance so I wasn’t charged the $85 but because THEY didn’t clear my insurance in time, I got charged anyways and the only email I found for them was their cancellation email. So I emailed them asking for a refund so they could use my insurance but apparently asking the same day they took the money was somehow too late even though my insurance had been posted….? Still annoyed. Still out of $85 but I called my bank and they said they’ll fix it for me themselves so hopefully I get that back soon. Point is, they’re not set up well and they’re very new so if you’re patient enough this might work for you. Definitely did nothing for me, except take my money and make me more anxious with a bad prescription.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for quite a while now and part of this issue with my anxiety was that I could not get myself to go to a doctor’s office so I found Cerebral and thought it would help. I was very wrong. I gave it a shot for a long time but I should have given up a long time ago. No one on their staff communicates with each other and if you need anything to be done quickly such as speaking to your prescriber due to a bad reaction to a medication or an issue with an appointment or an issue with being charged twice the amount you should be for medication, you will not receive any help. And if they do respond, it will be 5 different people who clearly haven’t spoken to anyone else. I now just tried to cancel my membership before it was renewed since my prescriber appointment was canceled by Cerebral 2 weeks in a row making a lapse in my medication. Instead of canceling my membership when I asked them to, they charged me for a full month for my renewal and then deactivated my account the day after. I spent all day trying to speak with someone from support to get a refund and the only option they gave me was to void the cancellation and stick it out for the month I already paid for. I finally gave in and let them do this, making an appointment with a new prescriber I have never seen before just so I could get medication refilled since I was ignored by the other prescriber. Now a day later I got a new email from a different person from support who canceled my membership AGAIN and I have now lost the new appointment as well. 

So please, save your money and try to find someone in person to help you because you will get no relief from anxiety from cerebral. All you will get is increased anxiety and have your money taken from you to not be able to do anything on their app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,When I started I enjoyed cerebral and was hopeful that this would be great for me. After the change of doctors I felt very uninformed of the sudden change but I let it pass. Then I call customer service because nobody was responding on an urgent matter I had about my medication and mental health. When I called to try to get things resolved myself I am told the systems were updated and they no longer accept debit cards and it canceled my subscription and started a new one which was on hold and news to me. I let that pass even though I new there had to be a correlation with the change in doctor. Then I look at my account and even though my subscription is on hold like I haven’t payed anything I find double charges that I’ve yet to dispute. I let that pass. Then I have an appoitment scheduled which is very important to me. Nobody shows up and I am again charged a 29 dollar no show fee. I let that pass. Then documents that I worked through the extremely ridiculous process of submitting (because my mental illness and the fact that my body is adjusting to the medication is hindering me from successfully performing my JOB successfully and am therefore on the verge of loosing my JOB due to call avoidance because my PTSD makes me avoid the triggers in which speaking to some people cause) get denied. I am so extremely dissatisfied and I don’t know how you all stay in business if this is how you treat everyone seeking your help for their mental disabilities. SMH. Waste of time and money for nothing but sheer disappointment. Never again!,cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"My experience with Cerebral was OK but ended with what I deem unethical business. * The service is pretty easy to use for the most part although there really isn't much to it. * I signed up with a heavily discounted promo with no problem. They do not work with my insurance so I have to self claim. I first met with a prescriber who informed me they are not allowed to go above my current level of meds so prescribed me one to work with what I already take. I was to meet with her again in a month to determine if I need to keep it or try something different. I had already decided it wasn't for me. * Cerebral says you can text with your therapist. Not exactly. You are assigned case workers. You message them and they pass your message on to your counselor. So don't tell them anything too confidential. * I informed them I wished to cancel my service before the first month ended for reasons not pertaining to Cerebral. They recommend making such requests a week before month's end to ensure you don't get charged for the next month. * An hour before my last appointment with my councilor I received several emails. They sent me another prescription and charged me $20, canceled my service immediately and canceled my last appointment with my therapist. * So much for our wrap up session. **UPDATE** Cerebral refunded the $20. A week later they withdrew $325 from my bank! Mind you, my account is deactivated. I emailed them and received a confusing run-around type apology. Still waiting for THAT refund.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I had one appointment with my “care” provider, and it was the most uncomfortable experience I’ve ever had with a doctor. She was slouched back, with RBF on the whole time. She seemed annoyed and angry. She also didn’t look at me once. I started using this program so I wouldn’t have to pay $200 a visit to see a local doctor, it had 5 stars…. So I thought I’d give it a try. I regret it. I have crippling anxiety, and this appointment gave me nothing but that. And I was forced to sit through it for an hour. I explained to her that my current treatment of almost 2 years was keeping me out of the hospital. And she told me she didn’t think it was working (though I haven’t found myself in a hospital gown since starting) she stated she would prescribe my current medication as a courtesy. I asked her twice to contact my prior provider so she can get some background as to where I was prior to treatment, and where I am now. She declined. That night I had my first panic attack in weeks. And one of the worst ones I’ve had in awhile. I took my last emergency medication, as she said she sent over the other prescription. The next day it wasn’t there, the day after that was thanksgiving, and yesterday they had gotten it….but no usage. So, it couldn’t be filled. 10 phone calls from me, a few from my pharmacy, and two emails later and I finally got a response via email, that they sent my request to another team member and it could take 24 hours, and to give it more time as it’s the weekend………. I’ve been taking melatonin to help me sleep through the non stop panic attacks for 3 days now…literally doing whatever I can to not go to the ER because of Covid. I think I’d rather pay $200 per visit for a doctor who will care, listen, and is reachable. Don’t come here if you have crippling mental health issues that prevent you from having a life.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"-Update-
Medication has never worked for me. Usually if I bad thoughts they are easy to switch around. Not this time the medication they put me on I couldnt even hear myself anymore. The positive me that is. I have been so stressed out trying to find someone to talk too and so much happening. I am not sitting in the hospital. I tried to kill myself on what they put me on. Turns out they even took my money which they don’t deserve at all. I wrote and email asking them for it back I received nothing. I am so tried of people walking all over me. I will give them today. But I think if they don’t give me this months money back. For legit just canceling on me all of this month haha have no idea what I paid them for. I will see another way I can get it back. Do not trust this app they are great the first session or two then they start following through. See an actual therapist. Im starting to wonder even these guys are even professionals because they dont act like it. 

So it was fine the first session? I can’t remember if I did a second. I do know my last session I was anxious about life events and REALLY needed to talk about them but kept getting cut off. I was told I could have a new appointment with someone tomorrow, and there was nothing available and all day I haven’t heard a thing back. I am now switching to better help where they took my income to account. And gave me a big discount. I am going to try them. I get weekly sessions which makes more since at 30-45mins then one session once a month for 30 mins. I am horribly upset because I have been trying super hard and because of these anxieties and then trying to talk to someone and not being heard, trying to pay for the service, And the stress of it. I ended up freaking out on friends, and a love one. I will not ever recommend this app to someone who actually really needs someone to listen.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,there isn’t an option to cancel on the app. you have to email them and request. to cancel. …like,cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"🥰To be clear, the doctors and customer service is amazing! 🥰
But the app is a confusing mess. My problem is with the links at the bottom of the page. The first link messages takes you to a screen with a typing box. It has no way of choosing who on your “ccc” team you message. Also, it’s incredibly difficult to figure out who is who. They have made up 2 titles for the people on my team. Cerebral Care Counselor and Cerebral Care Coordinator. Someone has a thing for alliteration, but these titles aren’t established anywhere else and seem randomly designated. The Counselor is the person you talk to about meds. The Coordinator is person who literally counsels you. 🤷‍♀️ To top it off, the titles are so long that on the only screen you can type on you only see the first 6 example letters of each doctors name “Richar…” with “Cerebral C…” to distinguish who is who. Unacceptable. Then there’s the Appointment’s link. At the top of the page says in faded letters “Schedule Appointments” but it’s not a link it’s just literally faded letters on a screen. Below that is “Complete Monthly Self-Assessment” with a start button. Which takes you to a 33 question test. Each question is on a separate screen. Each time you answer a question it takes you to the next screen, but you have to manually scroll up every page to see the question being asked. It’s cumbersome, and needlessly time consuming. Ironically, you’re being asked about how hard it is for you to finish repetitive tasks. It also looks like if you answer all these repetitive question (33!!!) you might be taken to a screen where you can schedule an appointment. Imagine the frustration of taking a 33 question self assessment when all you want to do is schedule your next appointment only to find that the assessment has nothing to do with making an appointment. To be fair, I am autistic with PTSD and ADHD. But to be BLUNT AS FOOK, I am exactly the type of person this program was made for. The accompanying app should be more sensitive to its clientele. It should have the most intuitive interface possible. It should be designed to be navigable when under extreme stress or when having a bad reaction to new medication. As it is, they have a panic button, but it doesn’t explain what that means. I was afraid it would alert authorities which is the worst thing to do in most situations if you are Atypical and a minority. However, I did just use it now to see what it was, sure that I was calm enough to handle police if it comes to that. But it turns out it’s just a series of overly long typed out calming tasks. Who can read paragraphs when having a panic attack? It’s useless. At the least they should have a Siri type talk you through it. Gods, even banks let you feel like you’re talking to a person when trying to reach a human. To be clear, I love my doctors. But if I could access them in any other way, I would drop this app in a heartbeat. I’m looking into Hims. Though as a queer man, I’d prefer not to go somewhere so male oriented.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"First of all, these people handout ADHD diagnoses like it’s nothing and ask almost no questions, with no true evaluation to assure the ADHD diagnosis before prescribing medications. This is so harmful and dangerous, especially when it comes to stimulants, which are known to be abused. People with addiction issues can be prescribed medications on here with no hesitation from the provider and people could also potentially be on here to get drugs to sell. I personally have been to a real psychiatrist since I was in elementary school and have been through thorough testing to know I do have ADHD and I already know the medication that works for me, so I wasn’t harmed by their practice as much, but I was SHOCKED after my first appointment at how incredibly easy it was for me to get prescribed medication from here with no questions, my provider told me and I quote “oh you are in college, you definitely will need this” in reference to Vyvanse. He also was so inappropriate asking me if I was a daddy’s girl and joked about marrying me and “breaking up” with me whatever that meant… but it wasn’t just him because this service will also switch your provider all the time without warning, I have had 4 prescribers in the span of 6 months… also they cancel appointments frequently leaving you without medication for weeks at a time. With stimulants the pharmacy’s are very strict with the number of days between pick up, so obviously you can’t schedule appointments so early and you schedule them on the specific dates for a reason, but they will cancel without warning and not have another available appointment for MONTHS… how in the world are you expecting me to just not have medication that I need for months… the medication I take doesn’t need to be weened off of, so that’s not a problem, but with some antidepressants this would be a huge issue and could cause horrible withdrawal issues. For me the whole not having my meds has happened so many times and this time is happened during my midterm week… awesome…. This is the worst prescription service in history, it’s also incredibly dangerous and does not take diagnosis and medication seriously at all. It scares me and this is supporting the misuse of ADHD medications for sure and it’s disgusting to see how careless they are. They should be ashamed.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"I feel like the major thing missing from this app is better communication. I struggled horribly the last 4-5 days. I was making it very clear to my coordination that I was low on my medicine and I just kept getting a generic response. My medicine was supposed to arrive on Thursday, 3 days without medicine, it didn’t arrive until Friday night 4 days without medicine, I struggled to get ahold of someone, extremely struggled. I felt very ignored and only pushed aside when I had a very serious problem, not taking my medicine and knowing if I still take it after 4 days of not taking it…:well needless to say my last message to my care coordinator I was begging to talk to someone and I was anxious and upset and “radio silence”. I felt very ignored and pushed aside and made feel
Like what I was experiencing was not important. So I went to a local pharmacy, and asked for assistance on what to do, and they informed me to take it immediately the next morning because I would most likely going withdrawals and if I didn’t take it it would be worse. So needless to say I got help from no one from the cerebral team in this matter, no one ever got back to me on what I should do after 4 days. Even with my last message literally begging to talk to someone. I had a meltdown and the people who are supposed to assist me did not. Now I feel like a fool and ridiculous for all of this and still no one has responded to my question of taking medicine after four days from the cerebral team. This is not how people who have mental health problems should be handled. We should not be ignored and pushed aside. If you aren’t in the business to care, you shouldn’t be in this business.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,i can’t even open the app without it crashing or going to a blank screen… useless as of right now for me,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,App isn’t working anymore.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have cerebral PLENTY of chances to communicate and clarify issues with my prescription. I needed it temporarily sent to another state because I was out of town. My provider and I had already spoken about this and she stated it would not be a problem for this ONE TIME but that if I moved she would need to have me paired with someone who had a license in the state. Okay, no problem. I understood what she was saying. I went to the pharmacy to pick up my medication and it was outrageously high and expensive. I messaged her and asked if she could have it sent to the Walmart that was in the area. All I needed was the medication moved from one pharmacy to another. It turned into the biggest issue OMG. The “coordinators” had no idea what I was talking about. And I say “coordinators” because the person who I was assigned to is almost never in so I’m always getting messages that started out as “I’m filling in for your coordinator today.” I spoke to two different coordinators, called their customer service, and emailed three different people to try and resolve this. I’m beyond fed up with this app. I asked to cancel last week and only learned TODAY that it was cancelled. Funny too because apparently their billing cycle ends on a specific day (although this isn’t stated ANYWHERE on their app OR website) so I just paid for an entire month of service for absolutely nothing. The app isn’t cheap either. For how much they charge people their communication should be way better. They’re helping people who take their mental health serious and instead they’re creating additional frustration AND stealing money. This app is a total scam. I appreciated meeting my therapist the ONE time and my provider was helpful, but their customer service and coordinators are pitiful.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I have been trying to cancel for over a week and have gotten NO ANSWER. BEWARE. This is a scam!!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"EDIT: TRYING TO CANCEL IS A JOKE! I’ve had to go out of my way to request a refund for the medication I had emailed to cancel. I cancelled 3 business days before medications were suppose to be shipped yet I was still charged and meds were shipped. They take 3 days to respond to emails and they respond on the weekends/late hours of the day. For a mental health company they’re NOT CONSIDERATE of your mental health when canceling. Save yourself the stress just don’t bother, go see a professional instead. 

I’m incredibly disappointed!! I’ve been struggling mentally and I wanted to try something new. I signed up for the care counselor and medication. Our sessions were only 30min each. I wasn’t sure if I needed medication but I was open to it if I really needed it. In my opinion, 30min is NOT enough to provide enough medical evidence for medication after only 1 session. It just seems like they’re throwing medications here and there and I’M not okay with that. I already have digestive issues from previous medications so I’m mindful of what I put in my body. I was under the impression that they wouldn’t consider prescribing any medications until after a few sessions not after the 1st one! I do want to say that the care counselor was amazing and provided great info. But again 30min was just not enough! I would recommend actually seeing a therapist and ruling out any other health issues before taking any medication. Be mindful of what you’re willing take, some medications cause more damage in the long run, I know. I will not be using this service or recommending it to anyone.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"If you don’t have a mental disorder, you will after dealing with this company!! Horrible! I’m absolutely disgusted with this company. It’s a complete and total SCAM! I paid over $300 and talked to a prescriber on a Sunday that told me she couldn’t help me and that someone else would reach out to me within the next day or two. Three days go by and I reached out to Support…these are the emails that followed: Wednesday: Hello, I had a session with prescriber Michelle on Sunday and she said someone would be reaching out to me to schedule a follow up by Tuesday, but it’s Wednesday and I haven’t heard anything yet. Is it possible to schedule that here? Thanks, Justin S. Thursday: Hi Judith, (They couldn’t even get my name right from an email) Good day! You just had the visit 4 days ago. It usually takes 3 months before a client receives a notification for a follow up visit. Best, Julius D Thursday evening: Hi Julius, First, my name is Justin, not Judith. Secondly, the prescriber said she wanted a second opinion regarding bipolar disorder.   You’re telling me this second opinion takes 3 months and I’m to pay $900 in the meantime before even being prescribed medication? If that’s the case, where may I find information on cancelling your services? This has been a momentous waste of my time and money. I’m very happy to share my experience with other people as needed as well. Your asking me to pay nearly $1000 to wait for nothing, and it’s a scam. Finally, it doesn’t matter if I just had a visit 4 days ago or 4 minutes ago, you should at least take the time to look into my concern because I genuinely hope this is just an oversight due to laziness on your part to not just simply look into it. So, for the second time: I was supposed to receive a call Monday or Tuesday to schedule the visit with that second prescriber to discuss bipolar disorder and I haven’t been able to schedule it. Are you going to look into it and have them reach back out or give me the resources to get in touch with that person, or are you not? Michelle didn’t say 3 months, she said two days and I’m on day four now… Thanks, Justin S Friday: Hi Justin, Good day! I do apologize. I'm terrible with names. I'm sorry to hear that you've decided to discontinue receiving mental health services from Cerebral. In order to move forward with the cancellation process, please fill out the following form. Once you have filled it out, kindly wait for the cancellation team to contact you regarding cancellation or any other requests. It is important to note that your subscription will remain active until this has been completed and a Coordinator confirms cancellation. Upon completion, you can expect a member of our Coordination team to be in touch with you regarding the status of your request. Once your cancellation has been processed, you will continue to have access to your records through Cerebral, but your treatment and medication plan will be suspended, and any upcoming appointments will be removed. We look forward to speaking with you soon. Best, Julius D Friday afternoon: Hi Julius, Looks like you opted to lose a customer instead of helping them. What a shame! I’ll be sharing this experience, as well as these emails anywhere I’m able to review your company. People need help, and your company is preying and scamming on innocent people and if I can keep just one person from giving you a dime, I did them a better service than you or your company has ever dreamed of. Not sure how you can sleep at night… Good luck, Justin S Employees for this “mental health organization” have zero interest in assisting, listening, or supporting their patients and that’s all the wrong things to be when you’re supposedly in the business of “helping people” BUYER BEWARE!!! DO NOT GIVE YOUR MONEY OR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIS COMPANY!!! *Update* Immediately after the reviews were posted, Cerebral scrambled to “fix” it and quiet me down. They offered discounts, refunds, etc; however I’m not looking for money, I’m looking to keep someone from making the same mistake I made. Cerebral has asked me to modify my review since this is an “isolated incident” but I encourage you to read some of the countless other negative reviews which cite similar incidents as mine. I stand by my statement- BUYER BEWARE!! It shouldn’t take this much effort to be heard and understood by people claiming they listen and understand.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"Be careful, they give you a very good cheap price for the FIRST PAYMENT but later on it goes UP TRIPLE THE PRICE. At first it said the payment was around 30 dollars next thing I know I see 85 dollars being taken out of my bank the next payment. SERVICES ARE MEDIOCRE! PEOPLE WITH ADHD I DO NOT RECOMMEND! There ADS say they offer ADHD SPECIALISTS and I spoke to a provider that is far away from being a specialist from ADHD, did not want to listen to what I had to say, misdiagnosed me, and did not provide me with NO MEDICATION (Remember, there services say that there packages come with PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDE MEDICATION THAT IS WHAT IM PAYING FOR) but NO medication was given to me, she even said that Stimulants are like COCAINE, which is misinforming and hurtful to say adhd medication is like a drug, it creates STIGMA. I told her I still believed it was adhd and she just brushed it off and said “well that’s something you need to speak to your counselor about”. Later on I went to a health clinic and got diagnosed with ADHD and Currently I am on Medication. After that I tried to delete my account and get a FULL REFUND, and it was a PAIN. DO NOT GIVE UP! CALL THEM AND EMAIL THEM! But most importantly when your on call tell them you want to speak to a MANAGER or someone that they can provide that is at there highest rank of customer service. Tell them that there monthly payment is MISINFORMING AND MISLEADING! And that your are NOT the only one that this has happened to, that you have seen videos, websites and reviews talking about the same thing. Tell them that the services were NOT PROVIDED CORRECTLY, and that you payed to get the RIGHT SERVICES AND THAT WAS NOT GIVEN TO YOU, tell them that they are taking advantage of people and that if you don’t get a full refund you will be in CONTACT WITH YOUR ATTORNEY! (Make sure to mention this cuz this seems to be the only way that they will give your a refund). Whoever your going to be on the phone with is going to give you all these excuses and explanations as in why they don’t give refunds and blah blah blah, DONT FALL FOR IT, PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN AND KEEP ASKING FOR YOUR REFUND! Tell them that you don’t want to pay for another monthly payment for something that didn’t even give you the services correctly in the first place and you won’t be using anyways later on! That you will not use the services no more! They might say the only thing we can do is give you a 30% refund, don’t accept it and tell them that you still want to talk to a manger and you still want your FULL refund regardless and that you want your account to be CANCELLED IMMEDIATELY. I was one of the lucky people that was able to get a full refund at the end, a lot of people just get the 30%, you gotta go Full Karen Mode on them. After you get your refund they said it takes them 24-48 hours for a customer service member to contact you through email about your account cancelation request, it took them 4 DAYS to get in contact with me, but after that I got my email and made sure my account was cancelled and immediately deleted the app.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

2,"The thing that makes me want to give any stars at all is the care team, otherwise it’s just been worthy of no stars in my experience. 
I have been using cerebral for about three months and every month I have had an issue. 
The biggest thing is that I have never been able to schedule all of my appointments each month due to lack of availability on their end the fact that they can only schedule one appointment at a time. The first month I signed up out of desperation, I really needed some help, but when I signed up and paid I found out that the only available therapist wasn’t available until the next billing cycle. I asked customer service if I could just withhold payment until the next billing cycle so I could pay when services could be provided. The response was a simple “no refunds” kind of response without offering any kind of productive help for the situation so I was rightfully angry and ready to cancel my credit card. Luckily I talked to another representative the next day who helped but was only able to find someone who was available halfway through the billing cycle so I paid full price for half the service but half service is better than no service and I really needed the help. And honestly, if you are struggling, there’s just no room left in your brain to deal with this kind of issue. Each month there has been an issue and I’m experiencing a similar issue upon cancelling the service now. 

So in summary:

This service is only good for the staff they have actually caring for you. To them, I’m very thankful. However, the company policies of offering zero flexibility financially when they themselves cannot provide their services to you seems highly parasitic and the lack of helpful trained customer service is staggering and will leave you wondering if they even listen. It’s not worth the hassle. The experience is worth it if you can get the service you need but you will not know what kind of availability there is until you’ve already paid and everything is scheduled on a rolling schedule so there’s never a guarantee of service. I’m sure it’s not always like this but it seems fairly common from the reviews I’ve read after the fact so if you decide to use this company, ask yourself if you are willing to handle this possibility first.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

As of this writing, I’m waiting to see when or if my account will be cancelled. This is a scam to entrap customers into continuing to pay for a “subscription service” that does not deliver on services promised, with the fallback being to point to very sketchy T&Cs.

1,The audacity of this company taking advantage of the people who need help.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"There are a lot of bugs with this app and usability flaws. 

Particular ones that bug me include:

Going to look at settings will result in receiving two emails stating confirmation of setting changes (when no changes were made). 

When choosing a care counselor I clicked on a picture to see if I could learn more about them and it selected them as my counselor with no way to go back or change my selection. I emailed customer service and they said I should be able to change them but tried in browser and app and couldn’t and asked them to tell me how and they ended up just telling me to email them if I want to change my counselor. But how would I even know who I want to change to? 

Odd ones include email confirmations of invoice numbers that didn’t include the number.

My app also shows I was charged for an upgrade I cancelled but customer service says they show they don’t have that charge.

Also it has been almost 2 weeks since my prescriber appointment and it took almost a week of my app saying prescription approved before I reached out to ask for an ETA that the coordinator told me my prescription was rejected by insurance.  I decided to go out of pocket and they put in one prescription and forgot the other. Then that prescription got filled finally and the other one has been waiting for the prescriber to get back to the pharmacist for some sort of confirmation. 

Getting access to the app was easy and the communication with my prescriber was supportive but so far the actual service is proving to be frustrating and inefficient.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"When I started Cerebral it was great. They put me on two medications that changed my quality of life drastically. My anxiety was severe and now it’s nearly nonexistent. 

However, the service and response time has gotten awful. When they changed my dose my medication price doubled without warning. I have OptumRx prescription insurance and have requested that they transfer my prescription since my medication would cost a third of what i’m currently
paying. It’s been nearly a month since my request. They responded saying they would get back to me. Exactly 10 days later I still hadn’t heard from them so I gave them a nudge. Same response, they’ll get back to me. I told them i was nearly out of medication and asked that they refill my prescriptions once more while I wait for the transfer since I was almost out of pills. As of today I still have not gotten anywhere with this and I have less than two days of medication left. The refill hasn’t shipped nor has it even been processed. I am terrified of what will happen when I run out of medication. Withdrawals from a strong dose of antidepressants can be catastrophic. I rely heavily on the anxiety medication as well. At this point I don’t know what to do. Every time I ask for an update I get the same response: they’re looking into it and will get back to me.

The only reason I gave two stars is because they prescribed me medication that gave me my life back. Now i’m worried that i’ll be worse off than before I started the medication when I start to go through withdrawals. 

If you are fine with subpar service, poor communication and having no choice but to get medication through them at their price,
go for it.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Terrible and misleading,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"This service has major potential.

The upside: 

1 - the prescribers are fantastic. They listen to you and work with you to develop a treatment plan for the short term along with long term goals and/or long term contingency plans. For the first time in my life I was treated with care and understanding for my conditions and issues. Those with mental health issues certainly know the treatment they receive when seeking help from typical medical professionals. 

2 - the “idea” of this service is fantastic. The idea that you have a faster track to your prescribers and the fact that they are able to send medication directly to your home removes the extremely strenuous challenges that those attempting to obtain typical mental health medication experience. 

The downside: 

1 - the first contradicts my upside point #2. The problem is it is just that ….an “idea”. The execution of this idea is what is lacking. You have a dedicated customer service agent that provides direct fast access to your prescriber and is also responsible for ensure your prescriptions are filled and sent as well as billing and insurance questions. The issue is that the service you receive is fantastic, when you receive it. They ask that you use a messaging system to communicate with your rep. You will be lucky to get a response once per day. If they do not answer your questions in full, you will need to wait until the next day for clarification or another response. 

2 - the timeliness of delivering your medications. Those of you would need a treatment plan that includes a medication know how important consistency is when it comes to your mental health. They simply cannot figure out how avoid issues that interrupt your schedule with medications. It is almost normal practice that I am without my medication for 7-10 days each month. This is disappointing considering I pay a premium, out of pocket, to receive my medication directly from them (or their pharmacy, etc). On top of that, I have to be the one to proactively work to find out why my medication did not ship, when it will ship and to make matters worse there is zero increased urgency in this situations. 

So you will pay a premium for your prescriptions, they will be severely late to arrive and you will have to track all of this down on your own and you have to expect to do all this working off of maybe one response from your care rep each day. This is on top of the monthly fee you pay to have this service (besides the expensive cost of the medications).",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Scam.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Cerebral is a fast growing company that is doomed to fall even quicker if it does not figure some key elements out.

First off the pros:

The Care Coordinators are responsive, however they dont know much, this is to be expected as they seem to not have access to much when it comes to the actual customer.

You can get medication quite easily. If you know what you need (previous diagnosis) they make it easy. 

Thats it.

Now the Cons:

Care Counselor conversations are incredibly transactional. This person is not someone that has an educational background in Psychology it seems, but more so a box checker- “Do you have feelings of ____ if so you can take ___” over 6 months I had a total of 30 minutes spent with my counselor.

Because of the lack of personalizations and frankly lack of true care I was experiencing, i decided to cancel my subscription. 

Now heres where it gets fun. The cancellation process is GRUELING. They truly are aiming at making you not cancel and it feels very gaslighty. The team is not very responsive at all. Oh and I cancelled March 10th and they charged me for my April “subscription”. 

Its very apparent that Cerebral is more focused on making their money than caring about their customer base. The company seems so promising until you experience the lack of care that should be present in a company that is dealing with people that need help and are looking for help.

If I was in dire need and this was my first experience trying to get help I would be concerned for myself. 

So much potential to change lives but the company seems focused on the numbers instead.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This app is a scam, don’t trust it. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!!!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"The service is a good means to an end, it offers access to treatments for a set of mental health conditions that make it particularly difficult to access care — multi-month waits for appointments, the stress of in-person visits, etc. This eliminates a lot of the burden felt by those suffering from executive dysfunction.

Massive concerns almost everywhere else. I am currently on day 7 of what is looking to be 9 days total of clerical hassle trying to get my prescription to be affordable — they first prescribed a brand name medication that my insurance would not cover, and also mishandled the prior authorization process so my insurer wasn’t properly contacted. 

Additionally, when prompted to schedule my next visit with my prescribing physician, I can see that she has zero availability for the next three months. From what i understand, I am to start a medication this month which requires more frequent visits than that in order to keep having access to. 

To make all of this worse, communication there is abysmal — the responses via messages in the app are not as prompt as advertised. I have spoken to two people there on the phone (which is it’s own accomplishment — the phone tree there makes this extremely difficult to access as it just tries to redirect you to use the app for all but one set of choices) and it is abundantly clear that you need a phone conversation to get quality correspondence out of them.

I think this all amounts to playing a dangerous game when they are prescribing medications that are habit-forming, like amphetamines, or which are outright dangerous to stop cold turkey, like many SSRIs. If they cannot provide reliable assistance for their patients it will lead to avoidable gaps in medication. This kind of sloppy, disorganized conduct will end up causing the very patients they set out to help to suffer unnecessary withdrawal symptoms.

I might still encourage people to use this as a way to kickstart their mental healthcare, but only as a stepping stone. My next priority is to transition my care into a local doctor’s office where I might actually feel like I have advocates. I would strongly recommend only using this service as that sort of stopgap, as there are some glaring red flags regarding communication and reliability that make it look like a bad long-term plan.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Cerebral makes claims they cannot meet. 

The first claim they did not meet is being affordable and accepting of my insurance. I submitted my insurance information and was only told the prices after insurance coverage. Turns out my insurance doesn’t work with cerebral so I was charged the full amount, $325, without being notified ahead of time. I do not think $325 monthly fee is affordable by any means. 

The second claim is that you would be able to speak with your therapist on a weekly basis. My first two sessions were about two weeks apart. Then after weeks of calendar confusion, on the therapists part, I finally got an appointment with my therapist who told me he is overwhelmed with the amount of patients he is getting on top of his private practice. He said it was unethical because he couldn’t effectively have therapeutic sessions and his wait time was a month and a half out! He wound up leaving cerebral after weeks of not being able to schedule him. 

The third claim is that you would be able to see a provider when ever you need. My provider would cancel on me four or more times regularly. I was prescribed a medication that needed a follow up and was not able to get that on time. My prescription was increased and I had very bad reactions to it, life altering reactions, but could not get an appointment with my provider so I stopped taking them cold turkey which is not recommended and was a horrible experience. 

The forth claim is that you could message your provider and therapist at any time. This is completely untrue. You have a team coordinator who can transfer the message over but doesn’t or maybe does but you never hear back from your therapist or provider.

I have contacted their support team 7 times asking for a refund for the last two months where I had zero services provided but charged a whopping $325 monthly!! Every time I get the same response about cancelling on the app. They completely disregard the content of my emails and send the exact same response. I should be refunded for my entire experience because I never received the services that were promised. I also had two months of horrible reactions to the medication I was given and horrible reactions getting off of the medication. I was unable to work or leave my house for almost two months! Save your time and money and find a therapist and provider in your area that will actually be able to see you effectively. 

It seems like cerebral bit off way more than they could chew and then ignore you when you’ve had enough of them not fulfilling their promised obligations. They completely altered my life and were unresponsive and have the audacity to copy and paste a generic email response from their support team.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,The worst team of doctors ever,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"just to start my care counselor missed our first appointment because she got the time zones confused. at the time i was a single mom working 2 jobs so it was really inconvenient for me to have to find another time. not to mention i had time set aside that was just wasted. apparently there’s no way for the care counselor to indicate she was the one who missed the appointment so ultimately it looked like i was the one who failed to be available. the sessions with my care counselor were not exactly impressive. i think i’ve experienced more help from friends. i did not feel
like she cared or was really listening to me but more or less checking things off of a list. it actually seemed to me that she was doing a worksheet and just asking me for the answers. i gave it another chance and in the second appointment she didn’t even ask about the main topic of our previous appointment. i decided this wasn’t for me and did not make any further appointments. i began to receive emails almost every day about how if i didn’t schedule an appointment then care plan would expire and i thought great i don’t want to use this service anymore let it expire. i didn’t realize, and they weren’t exactly forthcoming with the info, that i would have to formally submit a written request to cancel my subscription. after i went digging i found this out and immediately sent in my request for cancellation. the next day i was charged twice for cerebral’s service even though it had been weeks since i had even used their service. this was extremely upsetting because now i couldn’t afford to pay my electricity bill. i am already under a ton of stress being a single mom and working, having to take days off when my son is exposed to covid, losing out on pay, and now
cerebral adds to it by taking $170 out of my account based on “well technically you owe it”
i understand that companies have policies in order for them to be profitable but i don’t think it’s a good look to essentially scam those who are already vulnerable and seriously struggling with day to day life.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"For months I have complained about how I can’t make appointments through the app and nothing happens. My team said they msged support, I sent emails to support, no response.

After a year being on the app I had to start relying in my care team to make my appointments. Sometimes random people would come into the chat to ‘help me’ only for the next random person to not read the chat and have to start conversations all over again. Sometimes this would go on for weeks and I’d pay for a month where I got no appointments.

The last straw was when my prescribed was promoted. I made an appointment with the new prescriber given to me and it was canclled 20 minutes before the appointment. Then I was told my new prescriber, the one just given to me that I needed to update my expiring prescription, was booked solid for 6 months. The random care team ‘helper’ offered to help me find a new prescriber. When I said sure, the next two days had a new random team member, not reading what was previously said and telling me I needed to make an appointment. With a provider who didn’t have an availability for 6 months.

A real lack of communication and me paying all the while for no service or appointments. I unsubscribed from the service.

Since unsubscribing I have gotten the same “You cancelled you service email, 20 times. Sometimes 3 or four in a 5 minute period. I tried to msg them about the issue, but only got an automated response.

I’ve also been charged for my medication 3 times. On the 6th, 9th and 15th. When I finally got on the website to msg my care team, (because the app no longer works after you cancel) I was greeted by another random care team person, who told me to email an address I had been emailing for months about my appointment issue with no response.

Up front this app seems great. I had one year of happiness. But the management of clients and employees is horrible. Once one thing changes the whole system crumbles. In the end Cerebral caused me more stress than it was worth.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I’ve been a member of cerebral for 3.5 months now. I was initially diagnosed with severe anxiety and moderate depression (which is accurate, as I was previously seeing a doctor with the same diagnosis). I like how convenient Cerebral is and both my prescriber & care counselor are very nice and supportive. It’s also very affordable for people who do not have insurance. 

However, there are two huge cons for me. The first major con being the lapse in medication. I have 2 medications; one I have to take consistently on a daily basis with no lapse between doses or withdrawal symptoms can occur, and the other medication is one I take as needed when my anxiety is especially high. Currently, my daily medication runs out in 2 days, yet my refill has not been mailed out yet. Every time I try contacting someone to see where my medication is, I get no response. I’m truly worried about having no medication in 2 days and worried about what withdrawal symptoms I may experience because of it. This is a huge problem. My medications have always shipped on the 9th of the month, but it’s now the 10th and no shipment. Very unprofessional and concerning. 

My second concern is the absolute lack of communication between the prescriber and care counselor. For example, my appointment with my prescriber 4 weeks ago, she informed me that both of my medications would now be mailed to me (previously only 1 was mailed and the other was sent to my local pharmacy) and she said my medications would ship early (July 28th instead of August 9th), because she increased the dose of one medication and wanted that to get to me asap. However, my care counselor wasn’t aware of any of this and told me my medication would not be shipped on the 28th and she didn’t see anything that noted my 2nd medication now being shipped. As a patient, this is very frustrating, especially since you can only communicate regularly with the care counselor, but not the prescriber. Also frustrating as I was told my medications would ship early on July 28th, yet here I am on August 10th and neither of my medications have shipped. Even communication between my care counselor and myself has seemed to decrease and I’m not sure why. 

Initially, this started out as a great way to seek help for anxiety and depression, but now it’s spiraling into a nightmare. I really hope they improve their consistency in shipping medications as well as their communication, because I believe this has the potential to be a terrific tool for people with mental health disorders, but for now, I’d say avoid Cerebral as it will only increase anxiety.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I purchased an entry level subscription to this service in hopes to getting back into therapy after taking a break.  I have experience with licensed therapists and have seen several in the past.  I saw an ad for this service and figured I would give it a go.

If you have gone to therapy before, you know that it can be an exhausting experience and one that you sometimes need to mentally prepare for.  My experience with this app left me feeling worse than I did when I tried getting back into my journey.  

At first, things seemed ok. You go through and come plate a profile that asks for personal information and even attempts to try and help to see if health insurance can help cover - which was appreciated.  However, once I input my information in I was only offered one care counselor to choose from.  I even attempted to go back and remove specific things I was struggling with in hopes of getting an array of counselors to try and see who I would connect best with.  After three attempts to shift my choices, I decided I would attempt a meeting with the one and only counselor I was presented with.  Based on only one option, the calendar was hard to schedule with and I had to pick a date two weeks in advance to get a time that matched with my schedule. I didn’t think too much into this and started to mentally prepare for the visit.  Once my visit came along, I was on my call five minutes in advance and prepared to try and connect with the counselor.  My counselor was late to the meeting and once connected, proceeded to tell me that she didn’t have access to my records and was not able to meet with me at that moment.  I was a little surprised as I did not have any warning or messaging that anything was awry.  I didn’t think too deeply into this and agreed to schedule another time once her follow up email was sent.  To my surprise, the counselor listed me as a “no show” to the appointment (that I was present/early on) and I received an email stating that I missed the appointment and “we get it things happen”.

I honestly felt worse mentally after the attempt at the appointment and shocked at the counselor marking me as absent.  I cancelled my account immediately and asked for a refund.  When support responded back says later, they told me I should have read closer into the fine print and that refunds were not available to customers.

The whole experience was something I have advised against anyone else going through.  Very disappointed in this company and how they made me feel when attempting to get help/someone to talk to.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I had zero issues with my prescriber and my counselors (my original counselor left a couple of months after I started). Both were eager to listen, to help, and were truly empathetic and understanding. In short, if you are looking for a program that is fairly passive, Cerebral may be fine for you. If you need anything more than a recurring prescription and some basic guidance and exercises, avoid this service.

I had been on a leave of absence from my job due to the issues I was facing, and upon my first visit with both my counselor and my prescriber, I made this known. I also made it known that I would need a letter clearing me to return to work. I was told this wouldn’t be a problem. When I requested that letter, it took over a month for me to receive it. I reached out to my support coordinator and their email support multiple times, just to be given the same canned response that they could not provide that, even though Cerebral’s own website has specific instructions on how to request that type of document.

Only after my appointment with my counselor where I could explain the situation to her did I get anywhere. She explained my prescriber would be the person I needed to talk to, but I was unable to schedule an appointment with her. My counselor helped me to get an appointment, and upon meeting with the prescriber and explaining the situation, she was shocked at the trouble I had been through getting such a simple request fulfilled. She told me that I would have the note from her in my email within 24 hours, but she actually got it to me in about 20 minutes.

While my counselors and prescriber helped me get through the issues I was initially facing when I started, the resulting financial hardship and strain that resulted from being out of work over a month longer than I expected due to Cerebral’s lack of care about anything more than collecting a recurring payment from me has brought on a new set of issues. While I intend to maintain my treatment, it will most definitely be through a different company.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I started Cerebral in January of 2022 as a convenient way to get medication for my anxiety prescribed, and got the $85/month subscription for medication and counseling. In the 4 months I’ve had the app, I have seen my prescriber a few times and my care counselor once. I contacted Cerebral earlier this week to ask to cancel the counseling portion of my membership as my care counselor never reached out to schedule an appointment past my first session. Cerebrals customer service number told me I could “schedule an appointment with my care counselor if I wanted” which is untrue. Through the app, unless an appointment is requested to be scheduled by my care team, I’m unable to make an appointment. Apparently, people who are struggling with mental health are supposed to have to also go out of their way to advocate to receive the service that they are paying for. 

I also had a lapse in medication this week due to an error with my prescriber. I messaged my care team as well as called Cerebral customer service to see what could be done. Customer service told me they would reach out to my prescriber and get back to me within 24-48 hours. After being without my medication for over 2 days, I messaged my care team again, 24 hours after my original message was sent. I was experiencing withdrawal symptoms from not having my medication and expressed I was worried about not taking it for an extended period of time based on the side effects I was having. I had messaged my care team a total of 2 times over a 24 hour period. I got a message from my care team over 26 hours after my original message was sent giving me a “gentle reminder” that they are not a live service and to not message them more than once in a row. I suppose that I was supposed to just be relaxed about my lapse in medication for over 2 days and lack of response from the people responsible for prescribing it for me as I was experiencing bad withdrawal symptoms. 

After getting a call back from cerebral customer support and receiving my medication, I went to cancel my service. One of their options on their customer support number is to cancel service, and when you press the number, it tells you to email a certain email. I did so, and the email sent me back an automated response asking me to fill out a form. This process for cancelling by having to go through 3 different routes seems absolutely ridiculous for people who are seeking help for mental illness. 

Cerebral is absolutely not made for people with mental illnesses in mind. If I can’t get prompt response for emergent situations, such as receiving my needed medication, and am not receiving counseling, what in the world was I paying $85 a month for? I have picked up my last month of prescription and cancelled and will be finding a new mental health service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"After two months of this app I have decided that everyone should know my experience. I don’t usually leave reviews but this is important and you should know before you join. 

From the start it was rocky road:

1) while onboarding I was not able to complete my orientation for at least 24 hours as there was a bug in the system— I was paying for something I couldn’t access. Which okay I get things happen but it wasn’t a great first impression.

2) My first appointment with my prescriber was very impersonal. She did not smile seem interested or act very caring about what I needed other than “I had a lot going on”. We all have had days but this was my first interaction and I was underwhelmed by her attitude.

3) For my first appointment with my care counselor, I woke up early and was on time, but she did not join. Turns out she quit and nobody informed me until a couple days later. My first payment I didn’t even see a care team member— only a prescriber because of the no show and based on the second ones availability. And the second one showed up 10 mins late!!! I thought here we go again. 

4) I kept getting a notification to make an appointment with my prescriber except she didn’t have any availability for the next six months and because I was on Adderall this is something that has to be prescribed every month as well as meeting with the prescriber. So I reached out to the care team who was able to find a date sometime next week. The problem was my medicine was going to run out by the end of this week and my prescriber wasn’t answering the care teams messages so I almost ran out of the medicine and we had to get an emergency supply to get me to the next appointment. I’ve now found a local prescriber that will see me so I don’t have to deal with the inconsistencies of your platform. 

Overall, I’m really disappointed. I was hoping that this app would be a solution to me having a hard time finding a prescriber in my area. It’s only caused me headaches and stress— the exact thing I’m trying to avoid. How can you charge people money and not deliver consistently the services? Especially in mental health. I will not recommend this app to anyone because you cannot play around with someone’s mental health and you need to get actual doctors who are committed to the platform.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up because I was tired of having KP cancel my appointments the day before and even minutes before the scheduled appointment. Having already coordinated with work for the time off to take these appointments meant when KP canceled I used PTO for nothing.

I signed up for therapy and medication services and booked the two appointments. A couple days later my therapy appointment was canceled and no reason was given and no option to rebook. The medication appointment did go through and I was switched to a different medication, which is what I wanted to do and have been trying to get in to see my psychiatrist with KP for the past six months to do. 

Then a week later I could book a therapy appointment and completed that one. But still can’t book a subsequent one. I had already booked a medication appointment for the following month, but the day of that one was canceled due to unforeseen circumstances and the next available one is two months away. 

In the mean time I have been out of my medication and sent a message. They assured me that the refill order has been sent to my pharmacy but every time I try to order it the pharmacy says they need to obtain approval from the doctor. I relay this message back to Cerebral and they replied with some generic sounding message that if I need refills to reply back with a message. So I reply again explaining what the pharmacy says and they reply asking if they are trying to get an insurance approval. Each message I sent has said “approval from the doctor”. 

So I’ve been off my medication for a couple of weeks now and struggling really hard. I’ve read the other comments about trying to cancel so I won’t even bother trying to cancel. I signed up using a disposable card number and paused it so it will just decline.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’m shocked that this app has 5 stars. I assume it’s a lot of fake reviews seeing how most of the top recommended reviews reveal the true side of this terrible company.

I recently moved to Cali from a different state and had to change providers. I learned about Cerebral through social media (should’ve been my first red flag). I thought I’d give it a try as I struggle with ADHD and often get frustrated when having to find new providers that work with my insurance. Unfortunately it has been a huge headache. They refuse to let you talk to your prescribers directly and instead want you to work through their support portal in order to talk to them. This game of telephone has lead to multiple errors from the prescriber as well as severe delays. Cerebral will tell you they need 3 days to communicate with the prescriber only for you to find out the wrong or incomplete info was given to the prescriber which causes another 3-5 day delay. If you want to actually talk to your prescriber directly you must schedule an appointment with them, but you’ll be surprised to find out these prescribers are booked for more than a month out at a time so nothing can be done in a timely manner. This will prevent you from continuing or adjusting your medication which is not acceptable for a service you are paying out of pocket for on top of everything else.

If you think calling cerebral directly would work better to get issues resolved you’d be incorrect. They will provide little info and ask you for more time. If you want to speak directly to a higher up you’ll also be put in a queue that will last several days before the higher up will contact you directly. What’s even more appalling is that anything you discuss over the phone is completely forgotten or not recorded for “your” support team of counselors within the app. So “your” counselors won’t take the necessary next steps to resolve the issue and you’ll have to continue to follow up with your team within the app for several days.

This is a company that apparently prides themselves on providing adequate mental healthcare. However they do not actually care about your mental health as you are just another dollar sign. They spend more money on advertising than they do on hiring enough employees as well as training them to provide adequate service. If you have true mental health issues and are looking for help do not go to this company and risk the possibility of them making your mental health worse. I beg of you. They do not have your best interest at heart.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"I have been a member of cerebral for over a year. I used the service because I move around a lot and was looking for more consistency with my medication routine. At first, I couldn’t be more pleased with my service. I had a prescriber who cared and a care counselor who was useful and helped me in relevant ways. For instance, my initial prescriber went out of her way to help me get my medication at an affordable price and went so far as to call me on my personal cell phone to ensure that I was taken care of. 

Everything went down hill when that prescriber left the service. 

I have been bounced around to a new prescriber each month. This means that each month I must go over my entire medication history, relay trauma to a new person, and wait to get an appointment. Appointments with prescribers must be made two months in advance and most have very limited availability (like 10 PM EST). To be quite honest, that wouldn’t bother me too much as I was getting consistent care. 

But I’m not. 

Every month since May 2021 I have had to go a week without medication because my prescriber does not renew my prescription. Every month we go through the same routine (regardless of who my current prescriber is): I notice I have 7 pills left and message my care coordinator for a refill, three days later my care coordinator says they will contact my prescriber and let them know, after not hearing something for several days I contact again when I have one or two pills left, my care coordinator says they will contact my prescriber again and they will respond within 48 hours, I call customer service because I need medication, I go through sudden withdrawal for a day while I wait, I get my medication. 

If that wasn’t enough, I have been switched to a new medication regime with ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE from my prescriber. I was given no instructions or warning that I would be forced to go through withdrawal from my medications I had previously been on. As of right now, I have been trying to contact my “care team” for over 48 hours for hep with no response. 

The worse part of this experience is I truly, genuinely need help. I have been left in a state where I cannot stand for more than 20 minutes at a time (no shower, no driving, no cleaning, no cooking, no working). I have used every appropriate avenue available to me and have still be IGNORED by this service. 

If you’re in a situation where you are looking to use this service, please do not. I am begging you. My mental health is absolutely worse since using this service. The worst part is I am now dependent on this medication and cannot terminate usage of the service until I can get an appointment with a psychiatrist who gives a crap about me.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was very excited to be able to try this service for care. I have used previous companies in the past and truly have had positive results on all aspects of my life. 

This company on the other hand does not care about customer service. 

The availability of appointments times takes weeks (2 to 3) to be able do your initial visit. 

If you have any type of busy work schedule do to Covid or anything life events don’t try to reschedule!! They will Mark you as missed your appointment and charge you anyway saying you “used their services”. The second appointment I was supposed to be sent a reschedule link and that came four days after my appointment. 

Rescheduling... that will add another 2 to 3 week wait to your visits. 

An entire month of service for not one visit. 

Then trying to reach out to customer care to explain the scenario. There seems to be zero training. My emails (because that was the “best” option to reach them) are returned days later. Finally I decided after a days of trying to cancel to try them by phone. 

I was met by a customer service rep who was dead set on telling me know. 

I explained my work situation and how I had lost my job previously to Covid and that I was so excited to use their service but it seemed impossible to see someone. She said it was my fault to cancel and didn’t care I was trying to simply reschedule. 

I asked for a supervisor to speak to instead because I felt very much unheard (which is crazy for a counseling service) which was met by multiple excuses. Finally she agreed and said someone would call me back. 

Instead I receive an email from the same woman not listening to me saying the decision was FINAL! No refund even if you didn’t use the services.

Please use a different service for you mental health needs. 

I am so passionate about finding your fit for Mental Health and this leaves so much to be desired. 

They kept my money for the first month. No other options given to me other providers with better availability, no. Credits? No. 

They do not care about their customer or mental health.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The premise and promise of the app and service is great. 

The only bright spot for me was meeting with my prescriber — she was fantastic. However, there were several times that my appointment was cancelled shortly before our scheduled time. Once I was able to get an appointment, my prescriber asked me if everything was okay and wondered why I had cancelled our last meeting. I told her that I didn’t and it she was as confused as I was. 

I paid for 3 months and saw a care counselor once. Nice enough person but none of the information was new to me and I didn’t get much value out of the interaction. Mostly first-level advice and recommendations that you could get from a few books or blog posts. 

The customer support response time was slow and often many of my answers didn’t get resolved until the 2nd or 3rd time. I really wanted this service to work but unfortunately it seemed to be a lot of good ideas but poor execution. I had 3-4 meetings cancelled with my care counselor day-of and no explanation — just an automated email notifying me of the cancelled appointment. Then, I’d go a try to reschedule and there wouldn’t be any available for 2+ months. Very frustrating and unreliable, especially when you’re dealing with mental health care. 

Perhaps they’ll review this and other people’s feedback and improve. I realize that there is a huge demand and need for online mental health services and align with the premise of Cerbral but am disappointed with the overall experience. I’ve worked in startups for most of my career and understand the challenges of scaling a company but would like to see an improvement in the CX before reconsidering the service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I used this service for a year. 
1st: I did not want medication- just therapy. I have a trusted PA that I’ve been working with for years.  I was in crisis. My first therapist tried to upswell me on my plan to include medication.  I was upset and crying and just dismissed it.  Our second session I stated “I will not be discussing that any time soon. I’m setting a boundary.” And she seemed receptive.  By the end of the call- I’m sobbing about how sad I am and how hard I’m struggling.  She suggests multiple sessions a week and I said that was something I was interested in.  She then proceeded to dump me.  At the end of my second session.  While I was still in crisis.  They don’t provide that level of care- but she gave me a link to a local mental hospital I could go to get evaluated.  DISGUSTED.  I tried to cancel- and was talked into meeting a new therapist since I was already charged for the next 2 weeks.

2nd: this app GHOSTED ME. my new therapist was great. It’s why I was on this app for nearly a year.  She was not the problem.  Scheduling sucked.  You can’t schedule more than one session at a time- and can’t have a regular time slot.  Inconvenient but my therapist worked with me to set them up.  I’m in a pretty good place- but entering a VERY STRESSFUL situation (moving to a new country and starting a whole new life by myself).  I got very busy and forgot to schedule 2 or 3 weeks of appointments.  No one contacted me. I logged on to schedule an appointment and the app wouldn’t let me select the option.  I chalked it up to a glitch, and decided to try later.  The next three attempts over the next few days were the same. A full booking cycle had gone by and I had paid in full when I had zero sessions (AGAIN- WAS NOT CONTACTED). I got charged again- and reached out and was told that I didn’t complete the cancel.  I’m still jumping through hoops to cancel like this is a toxic gym membership and not tool for mental health.  I think my doctor was great- but I do wonder why she didn’t reach out, or if she was unable, why didn’t my “care team” reach out? 

Luckily, I made progress and am strong enough to make it through this- but I cannot imagine if I had been first dumped on the second session and then ghosted after nearly a year if I was still in a dark place.  Especially considering what both therapists knew what I was trying to heal.

 I’m my experience- if I failed to schedule- my therapist would have checked in until they knew I was safe.  There are good doctors working with this service- but for the App- it seems like a money grab. They continue to attempt to charge my card I have locked.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I was excited to start a virtual service, but my experience with Cerebral was an extreme let down. Additionally, if I had been in a poorer mental state this could have also been dangerous. 

I paid for medication management and care counseling. While there were expected frustrations like connectivity issues, late provider, or generic advice, the most egregious issue was with my medication management. 

During my first meeting with my prescriber, I made it very clear that I would not be taking a certain medication due to negative experiences in the past. Despite this, and without consulting me again, I was sent this medication. I contacted my “care team” and reminded them/expressed my concern, and they apologized and I was refunded the price of the medication. 

Then I was sent ANOTHER refill of this unwanted and unneeded medication, enough medication that could have easily been used to self-harm or at the least have negative side effects, which I was clear about in my very first meeting. 

After contacting my care team in addition to customer service, I was repeatedly asked me to explain the situation, which I did. My specific concerns about the potential dangers and unethical willingness to send out medication against a patient’s wishes, plus the lack of internal communication between members of the care team, were not addressed. I was merely offered a discount for the next few months of service. 

I asked for a refund of the undesired medication and for the month I did not use any counseling services since it was clear they were not listening, but these were not granted. 

Other less serious problems made it an annoying service: the advice or response from my counselor was problematic (wording suggesting we should be grateful for traumatic experiences) and the type of advice anyone could get from a Google search. 

I have had wonderful therapeutic experiences in the past, including virtual meetings. My experience with Cerebral, however, created more stress, anxiety, and exacerbated the concerns that prompted me to seek them out in the first place.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Used the app for two months. The app itself is a mess, lots of bugs, did not retain my insurance information, and the telemedicine function is also very janky. 

But I could forgive the above if the service was actually worthwhile. Basically, this is only worth anything at all if you have no insurance and just need access to medicine. The counseling function is worthless - 30 minutes a month and they forced me to changed counselors after one session with no notice or reason. Who wants to start working with a counselor and keep changing? 

I also had an issue where I had a bad experience with one of the prescriptions. I notified them and it went through what seems to be a bunch of different channels of decision makers until they finally got me a new prescription - but once that new prescription was filled, it pushed my other prescription’s refill date out two additional weeks. Now my monthly medication has a two week gap - not good for the obvious reasons.

When I relayed my issues to Cerebral, I got a canned “sorry you are unhappy with your medication delivery” and offered me 30% off for three weeks. What? I’m saying there’s a whole host of issues, one of which is this odd delay in one of prescriptions, and this support agent boils it down to “sorry we couldn’t get you your meds fast enough, here’s a discount.” 

This service is only worth it if you don’t have insurance and are in desperate need of *any* support for your mental health. It is not convenient, not personal, and does not make me feel like anything other than an active monthly user in this company’s pitch deck for their next round of funding. It is not a substitute for in person services if you have the good fortune of having solid health insurance.

UPDATE: Cerebral responded to my review about the company being impersonal with the same canned response from “Molly V.” Cerebral uses for every negative review. What a joke.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Cerebral tends to be money-hungry. Ironic for a mental-health app. 

Pros:

- My therapist was great. :)
- You get a selection of therapists that you can choose from
- You can dispute it with your bank for a refund, so that was nice!

Cons:

- I paid on August 28th for my September therapy sessions. I e-mailed in on August 29th to cancel my membership. Per my e-mail, I stated, “I understand that this month has already been paid for as I would like to finish up my therapy sessions for this month.” The Employee responded with, “I would advise to request your cancellation by 9 am PT one business day before your next scheduled billing date to cancel your account as we have no way to have it set to cancel at a specific date.” 

I understand there’s no way to set a specific date to cancel, so I requested to cancel asap as it’s understandably uncomfortable to rely on customer support to actually cancel a day prior to the next billing date. Once I cancelled my subscription, it *also* cancelled my service for the month that *I had already paid for*. This doesn’t make sense and is not customer-service friendly or mental-health friendly — it comes off as a money-hungry company. Why would you cancel the service for the month that you had already paid ahead of time for?  When it comes to any other service that you pay ahead of time for, once you cancel and get the confirmation of cancellation, it is applicable to the next billing cycle as you maintain the service for the remainder of which you had already paid for. After asking one last time for a refund and kindly requesting for said Employee to provide some Customer Support, I was responded with:

“Please be advised that we operate on a subscription model, the monthly fee is not based on services being rendered (i.e., receiving new medication, meeting with a therapist or prescriber). I do know that this is not the response that you would like to receive, and I sincerely apologize that we cannot be more flexible here. I completely understand your disappointment and do hope that you are able to find care that is a great fit for you.”

The Employee was kind and respectful, but as a Customer Support employee myself who also works in a Subscription field, I do not think much customer support was provided, especially when I kindly asked  for a refund a couple of times. It was rather a robotic response with a lack of empathy; you *can* be more flexible, but you choose not to; you can escalate it, give a customer a one-time courtesy refund so that they will come back. This may very well not be the employee’s fault, but rather, upper management. Given this experience, I will choose to not come back.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I used Cerebral for months to get my prescriptions and although I like how the app and service is designed in some ways, I can now confidently say that Cerebral believes in exploiting those who are marginalized based on my recent experiences.

I was charged $85 for services for the month of June and was just told yesterday that they could not provide those services because I do not have a state ID for the state I just moved to. For further context, I did NOT need a state ID to receive services in the last state I lived in and I communicated to Cerebral and my previous prescriber for MONTHS that I would be moving to another state and told them specifically which state I was moving to. 

I explained the situation to the person helping me through the “Messages” feature through the app and the representative said it was against Cerebral policy to provide me with a refund for the services that I could not have access to. I did not have a single session with a prescriber or care counselor during the month of June. So, effectively, Cerebral charged me $85 just to tell me at the last minute that they could not provide the care that I needed. Now I don’t have my meds and I’m out $85 as an unemployed person in a new state who struggles with multiple mental health issues. Awesome. Can’t wait to spend hours trying to dispute this with my credit card company. 

This is EXPLOITATION. There is absolutely no excuse for a company charging for services they DID NOT PROVIDE to you. Especially when your clientele consists entirely of people who struggle with mental illness. Shame on you, Cerebral! 

By the way, they sent out emails recently stating that they won’t be able to prescribe controlled substances in a few months so if you’re trying to get regular ADHD medication, they won’t be able to help with that either. Just seek treatment elsewhere, seriously. This app is a scam.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"In the midst of a mental health crisis I impulsively downloaded the cerebral app and began the registration process. I ultimately opted to go with a more traditional, in-person psychiatric care option and forgot that I had ever considered using Cerebral. Several months later, after having my debit card declined while purchasing groceries, I checked my bank statement and to my horror I’d just been charged $85 by Cerebral. After more digging, I found that the company had charged me a total of $200 over the course of three months. This may not seem like much money, but when it gets in the way of my ability to buy food for myself and my family, it becomes a big deal.

I’m currently pursuing a refund as I never once utilized their services; I haven’t even opened the app since I downloaded it. My initial email was replied to expeditiously, but upon them realizing I wouldn’t settle for their purported 2-3 day waiting period to *cancel* my account, much less receive a refund, they stopped replying to my emails.

Finally, one person processed a refund for one of the three months I was charged for, and refused to give me any answer as to whether I’d receive the remaining $115. I will be pursuing legal action if I continue to be ignored by this predatory company.

In my case they’re withholding a minuscule amount of money (by their standards) from a mentally ill man who hasn’t had the money to buy food for more than a week. I’ve been eating microwave popcorn for dinner, and it is quite literally Cerebral’s fault.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up back in late February and was given their earliest appointment in April the medication and counsel care. It was very inconvenient since I do have ADHD and was looking for alternative medication outside of Adderall and Vyvance; as well, wanted a more relatable counselor to speak with so I wanted to give them a try. The promotion was to get the medication for a low subscription price AND THEN being billed AFTER that once being able to try the medication and see if it’s a fit for you or not. Makes sense right? Well that’s not the case. I was billed $85 in March and was going to get billed again another $85 April, which would of been before my appointment date before receiving nothing at all! Before I have them a chance to do me so dirty, I cancelled and asked for a refund. The live agent was very kind and advised me to write an email to cancel and get a full refund. I was happy about that. Once writing their email team, two days later I received a horrible, disturbing response from them. This is verbatim:

Hi Dominique,

 

I am sorry to hear that you'd like to cancel your service at this time. I’ve gone ahead and processed your cancellation request.

I apologize but per our billing policy, we are unable to process a refund. Since we bill using a subscription model, we are unable to reverse charges regardless of whether our services have been utilized.

When you register with us, you agree to your payment method being billed beginning on the date of registration and subsequently every month while the account is active, even if you have yet to complete the registration, have a visit with a provider, or start taking any medications. Please refer to our Recurring Billing Policy and Terms and Conditions, which you have agreed on when you signed up.

This is Completely unacceptable and I feel totally taking advantage of especially after asking for MENTAL HELP! I advised other to not partake in this greedy company and stick with your local doctors provided my your insurance companies. Cerebral is just out here taking advantage of ill people that’s searching for help. Disgusting 🤮",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I am a phd Student and had this app recommended to me in order to help receive testing accommodations for adhd. At first, I thought it was great and convenient. Everything from your phone, friendly care coordinators, decent website. But then the provider issues started coming, and it’s been a compounding landslide of a fourth month nightmare.

I first used cerebral in October. To receive accommodations, I needed to get a form filled out by my prescriber. I emailed her the first week of November, was told it would be back by the end of the week. At the end of the week, no form: I emailed, and same thing. Eventually, after a few weeks of this, as well as bringing it up at my appointment in December, I still never received it. I sent another email, mentioned it again at my January appointment, was told it’s be here by the end of the week.

The first week of this February, I contacted my care coordinator, who said she would contact the provider about the forms, four months after starting services services. She did. I didn’t hear anything, and contacted her again. She said she emailed the provider but no word.  Through the next 3 weeks, I contacted the care provider three or four times about the form and getting it filled out, and no word.

By this time I needed to submit the form by the end of the week to receive accommodations. I called customer service, was told they will look into getting me a new provider and email me. They emailed me and I returned the call to schedule an appointment with a new provider. The new service rep I now spoke with was completely confused about the scenario. Nonetheless, she was able to get me an emergency spot with a new provider Thursday, hoping that I could get the form to submit by Friday. The new provider was in Tennessee. I live in California. Legally they can’t prescribe narcotics across state lines. He apologized and said, “yeah, someone over there is messin up man!”

I was unable to receive accommodations for my PHD exams, despite a four month head start effort, due to Cerebral. 

I’m just bummed, and it feels predatory. I feel like cerebral took advantage of those with mental illness by making it seem like an accessible service that’s easy to use. After luring you in, your connected with out of state providers, confused workers, and overly apologetic coordinators that provide apologies instead of solutions. You’re prescribed meds, and don’t wanna risk finding another doctor in fear of not being able to get them refilled. It’s been a nightmare, and having worked in medical offices, it’s just bizarre how poor this company operates and treats clients. A four page Q&A form with circle the answer questions, and four months in, dozens of emails, nothing but a few bank statements of me paying for this service. It’s a tragic excuse for psych aid for anybody who needs medical care, and if receiving consistent and safe medicine and treatment is important please consider other sites or firms.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Honestly surprised to see that I am the only one giving a bad review considering how unpleasant my experience was has been. Where to start? First, my “provider” shows up to our first video conference wearing a beanie and a hoody, like did you just wake up? I get it’s COVID season and we are having to do Telehealth but how unprofessional... Then to make it better my provider prescribes me a prescription which she says will be sent off and processed that same day to ship. We are going on 5 days with no update. 

The “chat” you get with your counselor and care coordinator isn’t live so you’re lucky if one of them sees it and responds when you need them to. I reached out to them and got a minimal response saying “oh she’s working on it”. 

Last night I sent an email to their contact support explaining my situation and received a response saying that my situation was getting transferred to someone else that dealt with providers and prescriptions as it was a very serious matter and would be handled as soon as possible. I waited all day and heard nothing so I called their contact hotline for live support to see if I could get an update on what was going on. I was placed on hold with a statement saying your expected wait time is 4 minutes... 12 minutes later I was forwarded to an answering machine. Have I gotten a response? Negative ghost rider. Will I after this review? Probably not. 

The moral of the story... If you are suffering right now this app is not timely and I hope you learn from my mistake and go get help that will actually respond to your needs quickly. Great concept but it’s a mess right now. Save your time and effort and go somewhere else IMO. I hope this helps even one person struggling so they are not stuck wishing and waiting for a promised service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Horrible customer service, once I told the lady that I knew she wasn’t gonna prescribe me the medicine I needed she said what you need to shut up and let me finish talking. And now I want to cancel but they’re going to have someone reach out to me in the next two days to cancel. And to get a refund. They need to say that they are not going to prescribe benzos even know it says that they do.Waste of time and money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I have been a customer of Cerebral since July 2021, and in my time as a customer I have not had a single month where there hasn't been some kind of issue regarding obtaining my prescriptions. 

Not to mention, upon signing up to receive Cerebral's therapy and medication management service, I was not informed prior to the expiration of the first month @ $35 introductory offer, which inflated to over $300 without notice. I should have listened to the warning bells going off in my head after this first incident, however I was not in a financial position to obtain mental health services from another provider at the time.

Cerebral's mission of ""breaking down the barriers for access to mental healthcare"" is laughable, as my experience with Cerebral has been one of facing constant barriers. 

Barrier #1 - I have not been able to obtain my prescribed medications due to FREQUENT issues regarding dosage amounts and name brand vs generic mix-ups. However, Cerebral continues to charge me for a bogus ""medication management"" service. Additionally, I relocated from WA to MA and was required to restart my care with a different provider, even though all of my information was already with Cerebral. I had this new appointment with a provider on Oct 1, but have still not been able to obtain 3 out of my 4 prescribed medications as of today, Oct 22.
Barrier #2 - I am unable to connect directly with my provider and am instead routed through a ""care team"" to discuss sensitive matters regarding my medication status and mental health.
Barrier #3 - I was PATRONIZED by a ""care team"" member attempting to justify the cost of Cerebral's services in response to an unauthorized charge of $300+. I subsequently requested that my concerns be brought to a supervisor, however I only received a partial refund.

For a company claiming to provide mental health support services, Cerebral falls drastically short. Providing access to medication for mental health requires the highest level of attention-to-detail and follow-through. Cerebral demonstrates neither. Inconsistencies in medication usage can lead to severe consequences, including suicide. 

I am obtaining counsel to support me in resolving these issues with Cerebral, and will also be posting this communication on Cerebral's Apple App Store as a review, as well as Trust Pilot, and the Better Business Bureau.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,"I was excited about trying this app – I’ve had the option of other platforms like better help and Talkspace for a while, but Cerebral promises online psychiatry, not just general physicians (to prescribe you medications) and talk therapy. I wanted the expertise of a psychiatrist when it comes to prescriptions– they understand the mind, and that’s the reason why I decided to try cerebral. Unfortunately, the psychiatry element is all marketing. My prescriber had no background in psych at all, no expertise in any amount of mental health issues, and made me feel so uncomfortable within the first five minutes of talking to him I ended up cancelling my whole subscription then and there. He giggled at really serious issues, made blanket statements back to me that sounded like he got them from an anti-depressant commercial, and behaved so awkwardly and strangely that it truly seemed like he didn’t understand even the most basic social cues, let alone anything about psychiatry. I am fully convinced that our conversation was his first encounter in the professional medical realm. 

Aside from that, when you are booking appointments with your therapist, you are only showing availability in the far future. It looks like everyone of their therapist is booked up completely for weeks. When you call them, they will be able to tell you availability within the next few days for that person, that you cannot see on your side of the application. When I had to reschedule an appointment, I was only given availability for three weeks later, so I had to call. The person on the phone told me my therapist had availability the next day. That was nowhere on my app. So you may end up paying for four talk therapy sessions a month, and only being able to schedule two or three of them, simply because you don’t know their true availability.Would not recommend.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I used this app one time. Once. I PAID my out of pocket expense for the only visit I had. 10 months later (while paying $30/mo for the actual app I don’t even use) I received an email stating $169.00 would be deducted from my account for out of pocket expenses for my financial responsibility. My financial responsibility was paid for though for that only visit. Why wait 10 months to inform and attempt charge me for this visit that I already paid my out of pocket expense for??

1,"Tried for two months. Got a antidepressant script the first month. Didn’t have a refill and couldn’t get an appointment or in contact with anyone for several days. Thankfully my pharmacist gave me a small amount of medication until I got it sorted. Fast forward 4 weeks, I’m almost out again, and go the pharmacy for a refill because my prescriber told me I would have refills for three months this time. Didn’t happen. Messaged on the app and they said they wouldn’t send any refills until I had another appointment even though I had my second appt less than a month ago and was told I would have three month supply. Nearly had to withdraw cold turkey from a strong antidepressant bc they’re incompetent. They also tried to sell me my script through their online pharmacy even though I explicitly requested it to be sent to my pharmacy the second time. Had to call back and forth for an entire day to have them cancel the delivery and just send it to my pharmacy. Try at your own risk. Don’t be surprised if your left to come down from an antidepressant cold turkey because you can’t be helped for days.

After they charged me $85 for the third time and I cancelled bc I had to go find and pay an actual doctor to write the script, I asked for a refund and the refused. What a ripoff.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I stopped using the services after the promotional month. Never booked a new appointment and they kept billing me. They didn’t even have an online cancel button until May 31st and when I’d call it would send me to voicemail. They claim they have a “no reimbursement” policy even though I paid for something I never received. That’s like paying for something on Amazon that was never sent. LITERAL THEFT!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Quickly becomes apparent that this is more like a bait & switch scam than a convenient and cost effective mental healthcare platform. Trial month followed by $85 recurring charge (not including $75/month prescription in my case), and no prescriber appointments were even available within my first trial month, which are required to start, or in my case continue, treatment. There is no option to contact Cerebral beyond the chat, and replies take over 24 hours (phone number listed has four option that all redirect you to chat within app). I have screen shot my chat history to document the two months of hassle and back-and-forth for issues big and small; among them, prescriber not following up with me initially for over a week despite telling me it would only be a day or two (and then incorrectly saying she had tried to reach out earlier - false), not providing required diagnostic code to pharmacy when submitting prescription, then providing me with the code rather than submitting herself as requested/required by the pharmacy. You would assume the refill process would have gone better, yet I was told by my prescriber that this would be submitted at the time we spoke ten days ago. I’ve had to contact Cerebral almost every day since then, and have been provided multiple excuses citing system errors and computer glitches as to why my medication has not been mailed or called into my pharmacy. Keep in mind, you usually have to wait at least 24 hours to receive a response to each of your inquires. Latest update is that they claim my prescription had at last been mailed through FedEx, yet was cancelled by me. Absolutely false, never requested cancellation of the order, and don’t even see option to do so, but I’m sure they know this. Cerebral has not been able to provide timely care or even basic refills, and at $160 this is hardly a cost effective option for mental health care. In my case, I am now motivated to seek psychologist/psychiatrist care through private health insurance as soon as possible. I am also submitting a complaint and review to the Better Business Bureau (not that Cerebral is even accredited). These are not certified psychologists or psychiatrists. They are also unable to prescribe the typical and most effective medications to treat ADHD (stimulants like Adderall). Higher cost and more inconvenient than visits with mental health professionals without your insurance plan.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I would’ve given 1 star, but I’m trying to get fair. It’s great people can have access to mental health, but honestly it’s just a team of unprofessional, uncaring “counselors” and a robotic mess “care” team. 

I was told very seriously I’ve been mostly misdiagnosed and really need to talk to someone more familiar with bipolar 2. I wait an extra few weeks, scared, unmedicated, yet hopeful I was finally getting the help I need. 

My appointment comes, told it could be a thyroid issue and to eat more red meat and given a medication I have taken before and know it’s not helpful. Yeah, so now I’m this even more stressful situation where a service meant to help a vunerable population takes advantage.

I asked for a refund. I not only did not receive help, my time was wasted, and I was told information that can seriously harm those with issues such as bipolar. Refused a refund, kept saying it’s a “monthly subscription service” even though I mentioned I need the refund so I can take the money and get the help. 

I will be starting a petition soon to have the attorney general look at the harmful nature of this service soon, look out for me @cererbalcareteam",cerebral-mental-health,,,

I tried to sign up with insurance and was told I was covered, the description of my plan was vague, so I called customer support who assured me I can get therapy with this plan. Then I spoke to my prescriber who told I might not be able to get therapy since I wasn't getting medication but someone should be in touch to tell me for sure, then I was told to schedule a call with my therapist. After meeting with a ""care counselor"" and trying to upgrade to my plan to meet more regularly, I'm told by customer support they weren't a licensed therapist, and there are no therapists covered by my insurance I can meet with, so I'll have to pay 194-300 /month to get therapy. Everyone told me something different, no one seems to know what's going on, and just wasted a bunch of time and (some) money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Cerebral was great at first. I liked my initial provider but they switched me to a new provider after my initial appointment stating that my provider was on vacation for 3 months. My second provider was even better. Until after 2-3 visits they discovered they made a mistake and my provider wasn’t credentialed with my insurance company. In the meantime, over my 6ish months with Cerebral, I was only able to get my medication in a timely manner for the first 2 months. After that there was an issue every single time where they said my meds would be delivered but they never shipped. I switched to having it sent to my local pharmacy but that was even worse because my prescriptions were never sent over and I would have to hound the care coordinators to get it each month. Back to the providers, the second switch due to Cerebrals error was my last straw and I decided to cancel even though I was almost out of meds and they wouldn’t help me get a refill. That’s not the end of my frustration with Cerebral though. After I cancelled all of the sudden in April Cerebral and the provider filed a claim on my insurance for a visit in January when there had never been any previous claims filed. They knew she was out of network so I can imagine why they wanted to file a claim now. The bill was $209.83 and Cerebral refused to answer emails about it until they tried to charge me $72.66 of it. I filed a claim with the BBB. Cerebral said they would reach out to me but a month later never have. Finally they refunded me most of the months services I paid for. But there is still an open claim with my insurance and they haven’t communicated with me to respond and confirm if they are still pursuing that claim. I switched to Klarity and have had a way better experience - no monthly cost, I only pay for a visit with my provider and my meds. My provider is fantastic and has timely sent my prescription refills each month with zero issues. Overall, would not recommend Cerebral unless you love change constantly and thrive on stress.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"First of all, I have an MA in Clinical Mental Health and have also lived with a mental illness for over 15 years. I know what I am talking about and am not some red-flag patient or drug-seeker who complains about everything. At first I thought Cerebral would be an a godsend after years of PAs and CRNPs running through different combinations of the same meds unsuccessfully for TRD in a large health system that had tons of red tape and overwhelmed providers with poor training who frequently quit. I had high hopes after my initial meetings with Cerebral. Now, about 6 months in, I am so fed up that I needed to post a review, because Cerebral makes good provision of care IMPOSSIBLE. I got set up with an awesome provider on the other side of the country who has been totally revamping my med regimen. She's wonderful and an MD, and the only reason I now stay. That's where the good ends. You get NO ACCESS TO RECORDS at all, not even when your last appointment was or visit summaries. If you need something like paperwork, rescheduling, testing, work letters, etc you HAVE to go through Cerebral's people- and you will get no responses for days or weeks, if you EVER get a response at all. For example, my provider repeatedly requested ADHD testing; they never sent it (in hindsight, probably because they no longer allow prescribing of most ADHD meds and didn't want to lose a customer by getting a diagnosis.) 
We later had to request a medical letter for work b/c of severe discontinuation syndrome while weaning off a long-time SNRI. It took several weeks and multiple contacts from my doc for them to send me the letter. (When they did send it, it had huge Cerebral letterhead with ""Psychiatry Department"" in big letters, so I couldn't even use it- I didn't want to get fired, but I also didn't want to be stigmatized at my job when the office manager was my direct supervisor. I ended up quitting my job instead.) My provider had to give me her personal cell phone early on, because whenever we needed something it would take so long (and sometimes never happen at all, despite multiple requests.) 
My ""Care Counselor"" changed multiple times and finally I just stopped even trying (I can't imagine how bad trying to get full therapy is). They were useless anyway; just gave you pre-packaged advice you could get from Google. 
And finally, they recently ""updated"" a bunch of policies regarding 1) what meds can be prescribed and 2) how clients will be charged and for what.
I fought for a week to get a cancellation fee taken off when I accidentally clicked on an appointment for the wrong month and it was only two hours away (ie, meant to hit June 20th at 2pm, accidentally tapped on May 20th at 2pm, and it was currently May 20th at 12pm.) I cancelled it immediately after making it when I realized my mistake- literally two minutes later- and they still charged me $29 and would NOT take it off, even after I escalated the complaint. 
Oh, and if you try to complain or get an issue resolved, however cordially, they will send you bot-generated policy quotes repeatedly without even reading your email. (They sent me the same automated copy-paste email reply 3 times that did not address my actual issue, proving they had not read the email- OOPS, fake customer service exposed!) 
Also, your provider will be very limited in what they can do for you. I am being weaned off of a long-time antidepressant and am experiencing debilitating discontinuation syndrome. My doctor flat out told me that what I really need is temporary benzos, but she can't prescribe them because of Cerebral's new rules. I've never had an addiction or misused meds or even been on benzos before, but I can't have them because of a blanket policy. 
So as soon as I get stable again on the new meds, I am OUT, because even the best provider is made useless by Cerebral's overbearing policies. Your doctor will not be able to treat you the way they should; Cerebral will bill you for an accidental tap of the finger even when no one's time was used, no one lost an appointment slot, no one even knew any appointment had been made, and said appointment only existed for about 30 seconds! They will not give you paperwork you need, and if you try to complain about any of it, they will have a bot with a fake human name quote policy at your repeatedly without even reading your email before finally saying ""you agreed to be charged the cancellation fee when you canceled"" (I had to, or I couldn't cancel it.) 
In summary, Cerebral: 1) Gets you in the door with great providers. 2) Cripples those providers and does not allow them to provide the best care. 3.) Does not provide any customer service or record-keeping, 4.) Tries to fake you out and make you go away by using bot generated customer service emails. 5.) Uses policy as an excuse for nickel-and-diming you instead of common sense.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,After first it seems like it really is worth it but trust all the lower reviews. It’s only good for maybe 3 months after you will never be able to speak to a counselor.save your money and just find something local,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I did everything in my power to cancel my subscription and am still being billed months later. Customer service line redirects you to email. This makes it impossible to speak to a representative and handle this properly. @cerebral look at this as an opportunity to create jobs. Kthx.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Stay far, far away. The app is clunky at best. Rarely are the video calls successful because of the service they use. However, NONE OF THIS COMPARES to the problems with the company itself. They are incapable of keeping staff. No prescribers or providers seem to last more than three months. Errors with prescriptions are too numerous to count. They forget to send it to the pharmacy or your prescriber quits and you have to wait for a new one before you can have your prescription refilled. The customer support is a joke. Its not necessarily the fault of the customer service agents themselves, but they are genuinely no help. There is genuinely nothing that they can do for you if you call in for help.

So please, I beg of you, seek mental health help elsewhere. Literally anywhere else.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"You basically as a patient have to be on top of making sure that your medication gets approved by insurance and making sure it gets filled. On top of that you have to pay monthly just to get prescribed, i would suggest better communication between patients, prescriber and insurance side of things need to be more clear.  if I’m paying 90.00 a month and the prescriber gets annoyed because I want it sent to a different pharmacy that’s not my concern. Sorry you have to take 2 minutes out of your day to switch my pharmacy. I also should not have to ask for a prior authorization, that should be done automatically. I should not have to follow up and ask if it was processed, I should be notified. 

Major improvements need to be done.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"Even though I have insurance, I figured shelling out $85 a month would be worth it to finally get some ADHD treatment and diagnosis. I signed up for the basic and cheapest plan - medication and care counselor. Your care coordinator is the middle man between you and your prescriber, who you have no way of speaking to in between virtual appointments. I made my first 30 min appointment with my prescriber and they didn’t show up, so that wasn’t an endearing start to this program. I rescheduled for a couple days later. That is a positive - I was able to get appointments very quickly after signing up. My first actual visit with my prescriber was ok but they seemed very bored, like this wasn’t anything they wanted to do. I was prescribed adderall XR after a series of questions and me explaining my symptoms, what I have trouble with etc. it was very easy to get prescribed adderall. So, great for people who need the help. The problem I had was that I never received treatment. I had to confirm with my care counselor - who was very friendly and nice - that my prescription was sent to my pharmacy. So I waited, and waited, and waited. My prescription still wasn’t ready. I had to go in to my pharmacy and asked what was going on. They said they needed the diagnosis code from my prescriber in order for my insurance to cover the cost of meds. This is 2 weeks since I was prescribed adderall. Another week goes by. I have to reach out to my team and ask what’s going on. My coordinator was very nice but I kept having to message them. I felt like I was in the dark. I ended up contacting support, which was absolutely no help. So by now, I have received a response in my message portal saying the diagnosis code was given and was just waiting on if any more info was needed. I had contacted my pharmacy again just to confirm this was true… they said the issue is still unresolved, that my prescription will expire in less than a week and I could pay out of pocket… but I have insurance for a reason - I will essentially be paying $85 a month for this medication. At this point I decided to cancel because my second month payment will withdraw in a couple days and I still haven’t received treatment! This experience was way more frustrating than I expected. I was so hopeful in the beginning but didn’t seem worth it to keep waiting and waiting and waiting and paying for treatment I was not getting. I submitted my cancel request (you have to send an email and your membership will NOT cancel until you get a response from somebody confirming). My second month payment went through yesterday, so I can only hope once my cancelation is confirmed, I am able to get a refund. Cerebral just gave me more unnecessary stress and I had to circle back, confirm, etc with my team. Communication is not great on their end. I will be seeking treatment elsewhere… seems pretty scammy to me. Would not recommend based on my experience.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up with cerebral on April 19. I filled out my questionnaire and chose from the 4 therapists listed. The therapist I chose didn’t have availability that worked for me until May 1st but I was feeling good about the process and was willing to wait. Yesterday, my therapist was removed from my team due to a scheduling issue. I was given a new therapist with no opportunity to chose. When I asked to make a choice I was given a list of every single therapist offered by the platform. I inquired if all the therapists offered are available in Illinois and if I was expected to search through what seemed like hundreds of therapists. My response received was, “Please know that there are Therapists particular in your state Illinois.” With no other support or guidance. At this point I have received no care and it’s been a week. I asked to cancel and receive a full refund. I was offered a partial refund and they cancelled my account immediately. I paid $79, received no help, no guidance when I was left without a therapist and a refund of $23.70. I am so disappointed, as I was looking forward to the convenience that this service claimed to offer.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

1,I recently attempted to get access to services but my insurance card was not being clarified for the app. I tried several times and did not get access to any content past the initial assessment page. Then ingot charged $85 a month later for a subscription I was locked out of. I contacted customer service and they issued me a $25.50 refund saying it was all they could do. This company does not cared about serving the population they state to serve. I would not recommend this to anyone.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,I was excited to try this and get some help. Explained how I keep getting different diagnosis and want a In-depth look. After 30 minutes she never told me what exactly she thinks I have but prescribed yet another medication. I thought ok I’ll try! THEN got billed $76.00 for medication THAT I WAS NOT TOLD ABOUT WHEN SHE PRESCRIBED THEM. I couldn’t cancel cause it already shipped and they charged me full price for the program instead of the “deal” and it’s hard to get ahold of anyone and no way to cancel without emailing them. Not very clear on how it all works and what to expect.  I was very hopeful but yet again another disappointing mental health idea.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Don’t go with @getcerebral - if you need help. Trying to cancel? Its impossible no matter how many cancellation requests you fill out. They continue to take funds automatically from your account. If you are suffering from mental health issues, do not choose cerebral. It will worsen your state of mind. This is four months later after signing up and immediately being told they couldn’t help my husband AND that they didn’t have services in our area. They took more money from our bank account, just yesterday. After one initial consultation in November 2021 to say they wouldn’t be able to provide for him. Absolute red flag company. Bad choice, go with something else, please take care of yourself and choose something better.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This service is horrible. First of all the councellor hung up on me after I asked an innocent question (why are you asking for my home state? I already provided that info). 

Next I tried to get a refund and wish to cancel the service. The support person claims the service is completely non-refundable and the intend to charge me $85 each month for the next year. The Cerebral.com website says “cancel anytime.” So the company staff are not truthful. Cerebral quickly deleted the part where I was told non-cancellable & non-refundable. The support rep says there was language to that effect. If that was the truth:
1) it was buried in the T’s & C’s
2) it still contradicts the language on their website.

This company is very shady. Buyer beware!",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"The first month was fine, whereas I received my prescription without any issues. (I’ll not even bother getting into the first practitioner I seen basically told me she couldn’t help me and was passing me on to someone more qualified. Just to pass me to someone that had zero clue what was going on so I had to start over with her and she was actually pretty judgmental- that was real fun, said no one reaching out for help.) The second month came and I had my appointment the same day as finishing my previous month’s prescription. Had my apt, doctor knew I was officially out of my meds because I told her and while having our apt reiterated where to send my meds and that she was doing so, just like the previous month. Thought all was fine. It wasn’t. The next day, 3/15, I went to my pharmacy to get my medicine and they had nothing for me and no new prescription had been called in. I left the pharmacy and went home and messaged Cerebral right away about what was going on. I finally hear back almost 24 hours later and yet still no prescription or solution. They can’t get thru to my prescriber or the on call. Meanwhile this place has many doctors they could have easily started reaching out to so we could get the prescription taken care of immediately. But no. More days have gone by. No one does anything to help knowing that the psych medication is much needed, can make me very sick without out it, and most importantly, how dangerous it is to stop these medications “cold turkey”. They finally message me Saturday(3/19) evening at 655pm, that my prescription had been sent. I messaged back that that was no longer helpful and they were days late in solving a problem that needed attention immediately. It wasn’t helpful because my pharmacy was already closed for the day and they are closed on Sundays. I wrote them this immediately and never heard back about what to do next. No one at Cerebral had offered any solutions in getting me my prescription immediately so I wouldn’t have to be sick. I feel this is very unacceptable and disappointing, being it’s a mental health facility. I’ve been home, alone with no help, with a toddler, sick for days because of this negligence. I had not been able to do anything around the house and struggled to even care for myself and my 3 year old because Ive been so sick from not having my medicine. Now that it’s been 6/7 days without my prescription my meds will be mostly, if not all the way, be out of my system and I’ll have to start all over. Back to square one! Getting to that point was hard enough! It took me weeks to even take the steps to make the appointment and start the process of speaking to a doctor and starting a medication. Now I have to look elsewhere and begin again. They know this, it’s a mental health center, yet are treating the situation like it’s no big deal. It’s a very very big deal. This is NOT ok and I plan to look into some kind of justice being done. I’ve read more negative reviews here about the same kinds of situations that I’ve just encountered with this company, then there should ever be. Being treated like crap by your “care team” who is actually there to help you just is not ok. They just let me get sick and stay freakin sick instead of figuring out a solution. What kind of mental health facility does that?! Bottom line, I don’t recommend Cerebral to anyone. I’m now taking the steps to cancel this service, try to get reimbursed for the money they have just taken out and for the prescription they charged me for that the sent out(that is still not even here and won’t be here until Wednesday. That’s about 10 days from my appointment date that I would be receiving my medication because of a mistake on their end. I’ll update if I have any issues on getting my money back.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Paid $139 upfront to learn first available prescriber appt is 10 days away; even longer for any therapist. You cannot get help by phone. Emailed immediately to cancel, they said Sorry no refunds but we’ll give you $41.70 back… Yes, seriously. UPDATE 3/15/22: Cerebral still refuses to refund, saying it’s a subscription service and I’ll be billed regardless if they provide any services. In my case, the services I needed (with require speaking to a human) would not be available for 2 weeks. I can’t wait that long; withdrawals from my Rx are horrible. There is a reason they make you give your credit card info before they show you who/when your options are. BTW these are NOT psychiatrists or psychologists, and who knows what their qualifications are for ‘prescribers.’ Total scam.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I opened an account with Cerebral on 3/10/22 and they immediately debited my account $30 on 3/10/22. I’m supposed to have my first appointment with the psychiatrist tomorrow, 3/12/22 and I went to log into my cerebral account and it keeps telling me no account found. I hit reset password, although I know there’s no way I forgot my password when I just made the account, and after I hit the reset password it said it would send me an email regarding reset. It’s been over 40 mins now and I still haven’t received it yet, yes I even checked my JUNK emails. I call customer service and the nice lady said she could see my account is open and active and we have to wait for the “support” team to contact me back regarding log in issues. She said my appt will still happen via telephone and the provider will call me tomorrow morning, we will see. So far, I don’t have high expectations from this service and if it continues like this, I will be canceling my account.",cerebral-mental-health,,,

When I went to go to my appointment the next day, I found it was actually for the following month so I contacted cerebral for a refund and went to therapy elsewhere since I didn’t want to wait a month. They canceled my account but refused to refund the entire amount and only refunded $29. They said we’re a subscription service like Netflix or Hulu and they don’t offer refunds. So beware. Their therapists have no availability and they are stealing from you. I would not use this service.

I needed to see someone asap 😩 I texted the app again and received no response, after six days I called and now they are telling me my insurance isn’t accepted!! This has been so frustrating. I just needed help..",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I joined cerebral back in October 2021 using a trial code to only pay $30 for the first month regardless of which package. I have filed a complaint with the FTC as they have broken a lease or regulation regarding subscription cancelation ease and have extremely bad business practices. I suggest others who have had A similar experience do the same, in hopes that cerebral will be required to change and prevent others from having to go through the stress.

My personal experience:
I got to meet with a nurse in the first week, however the half hour allotted ended up being less than 5 minutes. The nurse was 15 minutes late and didn’t make up for it with extra minutes after the appointment would’ve ended, and she left our appointment five minutes before it was scheduled to end. I was told I should get the premium package with therapy (after I expressed I wasn’t interested in that because I have a in person therapist) and I was also told that I need to speak to a different nurse practitioner.
A week goes by and finally the app allowed me to schedule with the different nurse practitioner. It would be near the end of my trial but that was OK. However, an emergency on my end came up and I had to cancel my appointment. Her next available appointment wasn’t for another three months! Cerebral would not let me schedule with a different nurse, only her. Even if I wanted to temporarily cancel my subscription until then, my appointments would all be canceled as well. So, my only option was to schedule that appointment and pay $85 minimum for three more months before I could even potentially get help. 
In the third of my fourth week, I was scheduled to meet with a doctor. Cerebral canceled my appointment about 24 hours before it was scheduled. Her next availability wasn’t until weeks after my trial would end, so I tried looking for other doctors with their service. Again, I can schedule with anyone other than that person.
I wrote a complaint and asked to unsubscribe via email to their customer support. It took them three days to respond at which point they said they can’t offer me a refund. That’s OK, I just wanted to stop my subscription. When they emailed me back, they said I had missed the deadline (according to the TOS; two business days by 9 AM via email before the new invoice is printed) I would need to pay the $85 for the upcoming month, even though I wouldn’t have access to my account because I had canceled. I responded back to them because my initial email which was sent before that deadline stated I wanted to cancel, and their initial response didn’t occur until a few hours after the deadline- which gave me zero opportunity to try to properly cancel (again). They responded back and said they cannot help me.
I had to put a lock on my bank account for over a month to avoid their attempts at charging me. I was getting emails demanding I pay it. Eventually, it stopped and I haven’t heard from them again.
However, making a subscription harder to cancel than it is to sign up for is against FTC’s laws and regulations. 

And, a heads up-if you do decide to switch your program with the trial offer (which clearly states it is for any of the programs), it will try to charge you the full price’s difference. Even though the receipt will say $0 due, when you hit submit to switch to a premium plan during your trial period, it will automatically try to charge your bank over $200 for a few days. I contacted customer support about this, and they were again of no help.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"This app is a scam. After filling out my info & the questionnaire, I was told there was a problem finding therapists licensed in my state & to try again later. I tried several times over the course of several days with the same result. When I reached out to support I was told the error would be resolved quickly & to keep trying. After 5 days of this I decided to give up & I asked for a refund since I had never been matched with a therapist. I was told the service, “is like Netflix or Hulu,” & refunds were not available since it was a subscription service. At no point was I ever matched with a therapist.

It was difficult to upload my insurance and when it was time to get my prescription refilled they took forever to send it through. Since I wasn’t getting the services I wanted I decided to cancel. They told me if I was to get charged it would be refunded. They charged my account three days later and when I asked for the refund the said they couldn’t do it due to the fact that I cancelled outside the renewal date, but their providers didn’t help me in that time and that’s why I cancelled.

1,What a scam. As part of the sign up process you have to pay for the first month before you can see available providers or schedule an appt. That should have been a red flag. Turns out there was only one provider and the first appt was 6 weeks out so I immediately sent a cancellation email. They charged me $14.95 for that. After complaining I was told it was a subscription service and there are no refunds (even though I never actually completed sign up). Eventually they agreed to refund $4.35. What a joke. Stay away.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"So, I signed up after seeing on TikTok. Sounded great and easy. This was December 10th. As part of this, you agree to their subscription model that bills monthly. Fine. But after you pay and agree to this, they say ooh ok well the first appointment is January 9th. And your “care counselor” appt is 17th of January. So then what am I paying for?!?  I spoke to a client services team meme we who said no worries, just fill out this cancellation form and someone will be in touch about your refund. Four days later I hear back from them and they say, “ We’re happy to help in any way we can, but we’re limited in our ability to deviate from our billing policy. Here at Cerebral, we bill based on a subscription model. This includes access to the entire platform and all its features. This subscription is similar to streaming services like Netflix or Hulu where you’re billed regardless of use to keep the subscription active. Understandably, this may be disappointing, but we’re unfortunately unable to issue a full refund because our services were accessible to you.” Seriously? How were your services accessible to me in the ten minutes it took me to cancel when I am not able to speak to a prescriber for a whole month?!? DISGRACEFUL",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Cerebral.com’s system is designed to get your credit card information before you have chosen services.  Even if you do not want medication, you will receive a call from a medication specialist so they can charge you for that service (even if you tell the interviewer that you do not want medication).  If you make an appointment to speak with a counselor, you will immediately be charged for that future appointment.  Cancelling the appointment does not reverse the charge (even if you cancel more than a week in advance).  Requesting a refund gets a reply saying they are sorry but their system does not permit refunds.  The whole thing is a fraud to charge you whether you choose to use their services or not.  I have complained about them to the Better Business Bureau (where they already have a grade of F).  I will update this review if Cerebral.com finally responds to my repeated requests for a refund.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"I used this app for 2 months. The first month it was great but unfortunately ran into issues when I needed a prescription refill. My physician didn’t send it into the pharmacy she said that she would. Despite reaching out for support it took over a week to resolve and I was out of medication for that period of time. I don’t like that I couldn’t reach out to my physician directly for something so simple and instead had to rely on a care team to process the request. Also they don’t accept my insurance so I paid full price for a month of services I didn’t receive. So I’m ditching the app and will find a doc irl that accepts my insurance. 

It should be noted that Cerebral doesn’t do refunds even if they fail to deliver the services you pay for with your subscription :/",cerebral-mental-health,,,
2,"My experience with Cerebral has been lackluster at best. At first, after initially having a consultation with the psychiatric nurse practitioner and then scheduling and meeting with my care provider, I thought this was good. 

My experience after that has been less than stellar. It turns out there was an error with getting my medicine filled. Which caused a delay. I understand times are tough, etc. but I was told it was an error in their system, not necessarily the pharmacy’s fault. 

I finally got my medication and began taking it. I was supposed to take two medications. One I was to take one pill a day for two weeks and then take two a day until my refill came in. 

Here it is the end of December, and I’ve only received on round of medication. I asked why it wasn’t filled out because it’s important to take your medicine as prescribed and not miss a dose. I reached out to my care provider who said it appears there was, get this, another error in fulfilling my medication so I didn’t have any medicine whatsoever. 

They sent in a prescription to my local pharmacy that I had to pay additional money for, to hold me over for two weeks until my new medicine is sent to me. 

What bothered me was that one of the medicines that I was taking two of (went from 20mg to 40mg) was refilled for..20mg. And I was told to only take one day. The dosage and instructions are completely messed up. The communication is completely out of alignment. I broke this down to my care provider out of concern that the nurse practitioner wasn’t even following the medication instructions she gave me. I was simply followed up with a “We are sorry. This is our fault” with no further corrections provided. Literally so now I’m taking a smaller dosage then what I’m supposed to be taking because the practitioner didn’t send in the new dosage that I have been on. It’s not been consistent and the attention to details and errors are too lackluster to recommend this service right now. You shouldn’t guarantee a service when you can’t fulfill your duties to your patients. I’ve now paid over $200.00 and have only had one prescription filled (plus out of costs prescription for pharmacy) and two small 30 minute sessions with a care counselor that you barely even have time to really work through problems with for it to be even remotely worthwhile. In my experience, the care manager really only works as a liaison between you and the company but that’s about it. And due to my issues so far in regards to prescription fulfillment, I’d look into other services.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I requested to cancel as you cannot do so yourself going to subscription information. The care was great but due to other reasons I was not interested in continuing. I requested to cancel, and was charged for the next months fee the following day. Since contacting about canceling via email. I was told it has to go into review by a cancellation team. I haven’t been notified if my account was cancelled or not. During those multiple emails, I requested a refund multiple times for this upcoming month that I am not using, again I requested cancellation the day prior to being charged.
Request for cancellation: 11/11/21
Day of charge to my card: 11/12/21
It’s been days since I was told I would be contacted about a refund. My multiple requests to have my money refunded has been responded by that is not the support teams responsibility and someone else will contact me. 
I contact my bank, and now find out the $325 I was charged without my permission may not return to my account before the dispute is found to be in my favor or not.  Timeframe on finding out is anywhere up to 90 days. Reason for the possible delay. The company is hard to reach. They won’t even give me the information I’m asking for, so guess I’ll be waiting the 90 days. Care was great but the customer service feels criminal, I’m charged after requesting cancellation, cannot get an answer from the company, and my bank is telling me if they don’t hear from them with a solution its 90 days….

In a final statement, again the treatment was great by therapist and prescriber. However the company itself needs to care about the consumers. I have been shown here they fall short.

Nevertheless, I waited for the psychiatric team to reach out which the provider said would be within 24 hours, nothing happened.

1,"At first I thought cerebral was the answer to my prayers. I’ve been diagnosed with major depression and severe anxiety. The cost of health care and medications was becoming too much for me. Here I had the option to pay to have my medication prescribed to me and it was affordable. For two months I actually believed everything would be ok and that I could actually live a normal life. I was told not to just stop taking my medication so When it came to refills I would just contact my care team and from my understanding my prescribing dr would send it in. These people have forced me to go cold turkey waiting for the soonest appointment with my prescribing physician, it will be a little over a week before I would get to see her. I got frustrated and my anxiety was at an all time high , My mood up and down all day yesterday I was feeling the affects and I started to panic I practically begged them to help me and when I said I’d probably get faster help seeing someone in person they said.. ok send an email to cancel bye. They don’t really care about you all they want is your money.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,The service isn’t that great I didn’t even get to me to Care counselor and The prescriber doesn’t really help.So because of this I tried to cancel but couldn’t find where to cancel it and ended up getting charged for another month after getting horrible service.,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"A couple weeks ago I was trying to enter my insurance information into the website & app.  I have “Direct Care Administrators” insurance.  This is listed on the drop down of accepted insurances for medical & for prescription on both your website & your app.  So I assumed there was an error happening with the app.  I sent a email in to support.  I kept getting emails with “FAQ” and not anything to actually help me.  I decided that since my insurance was listed & I would benefit from therapy services as well to go ahead and sign up for the prescription, counselor, & therapy option.  I do this thinking my insurance was accepted by cerebral so it would not be a huge charge to me directly as my insurance was again listed as an accepted insurance on both the medical & prescription drop downs on the website & app.  When I went to do this once I selected to upgrade there was no option to go back, I was informed I would be charged “the difference” from what I had already paid to the upgrade.  There was zero mention anywhere saying refunds would only be given at 50%.  Since I couldn’t go back I had no option but to keep going forward despite the website not registering my insurance that was listed on the drop down.  Because it wouldn’t accept my insurance when I tried to enter it after selecting from the drop down of accepted insurance & then I saw a $240 charge to my checking account I immediately cancelled the “upgrade” & change it back to what I previously selected which was prescription & counseling.  I then called into Cerebral to figure out why my insurance was on the drop down & the app not website would take it when I entered my insurance information.  I was told by the person I spoke to when I called in that my insurance was not actually accepted by cerebral for medical but was accepted for prescription.  It was listed in both areas in the drop down on the app & website.  I asked if I could be refunded for the upgrade that was made on my account & immediately changed back to prescription & counseling.  I was informed I would be & she would notify the department who was responsible for refunds.  I was never told anything about a refund not being for the full $240.  This was an error on Cerebral’s part for having listed my insurance as being accepted by Cerebral on the website & app.  Had my insurance been accepted like the drop downs on the website & app showed it was I would have remained with the higher plan.  But because it wasn’t I can’t afford to pay for therapy services out of pocket.  So I cancelled it & figured I would need to find a provider who accepted my insurance.  I then noticed a few days later a $120 refund into my account.  I was charged $240, not $120 so because I was confused as to why I wasn’t refunded the full $240 for a service I was never provided, was only upgraded in my account for a total of less than 5 minutes, I called Cerebral again.  The person I spoke to when I called said there was a “policy of 50%” refund.  I asked where I would have been informed of this because had I known that this existed I would have called in to verify my insurance as opposed to upgrading with the knowledge of being informed by your website & app that my insurance was accepted.  I was told this was something that was “only on our end” as in that I the customer couldn’t see anywhere that this 50% refund policy even existed & only people on the Cerebral employee end could see.  It’s extremely poor customer service & extremely poor treatment for a service that is to be providing mental health services.  The person I spoke to despite me trying to explain this continued to read a scripted message over me trying to talk to her.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, she responded saying “you want to speak with a supervisor?”  I said “yes”.  She responded saying “there isn’t one available but I can have a supervisor give you a call back”.  I told her I would like for this to happen & the call ended.  It has been 5 days now & I haven’t received any call back from a supervisor.  Out of my own curiosity because I didn’t recall seeing on the app or website anything about a “50% refund” I went looking through all of the “FAQ” areas, all of the website & was unable to locate anything that said this.  I assumed maybe it showed up when I went to upgrade plans, so I went back to the upgrade area & figured I would click to upgrade & since I already was aware once you select to upgrade that you can’t go back on the app I decided I would just close out the app instead of selecting the only option on the app which was to go forward I would close the app out completely & not upgrade.  So I went to do this, & when I selected to upgrade to the prescription, counseling, & therapy services there was a pop up this time that did not happen before when I had done this & was charged $240.  The pop up informed me that Cerebral was not able to provide “therapy services in my state” (Utah).  So Cerebral showed my insurance as an accepted insurance in their drop down list despite it not being accepted by them, charged me for medical services that they legally cannot even provide in my state, and despite both of these problems being at the fault of Cerebral misinforming customers they refused to refund me for the full $240 I was charged. When upgrading it also does not tell you what the cost is for the higher plan, it only says you will be charged for the difference of the plan you selected originally and the upgraded plan.  I would highly recommend anyone considering using Cerebral to call them directly before signing up, selecting any services, etc.  From my experience what I was told on the app & website was not at all accurate.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I’m having the most difficult time with this app and site completely. I accidentally entered my email in wrong because they don’t require a second authentication space for emails in case you have a typo. Nobody can find the account I created, my email isn’t being received to their support staff on their end. I cannot log in to see my credentials to update my information or cancel my subscription if I wanted to. I originally tried changing my email address on their app to the correct one and the app would not change it, it gave me error codes for literally everything on their app (payment, I’d verification, invalid address (even thought it’s not), etc. then logged me out and will not allow me to login. The app itself is not allowing me to access my account even after the changes made by the support team or will put an error code up saying to contact them. I’m extremely unhappy as I’m a completely new user. This experience does not make me want to continue using this app and makes me want to cancel subscription services and bite to bullet to go to in person therapy and pay that cost. I really hope if I do decide to keep and not cancel that this issue NEVER happens again. The people building the website/app NEED to add a feature where you input your email address TWICE so issues like this can be avoided completely. If I have to enter my password in twice why not do email as well?? It doesn’t make any sense and allows for small error to make your life hectic trying to fix the issue.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Honestly if you want the “care counseling” that is offered go to Therapistaid.com the resources are the same and it’s cheaper. Care counseling is listed on my “plan”, however I was told I would not receive that service with private pay (though I use insurance) and that I would have to pay $85 out of pocket to gain a service that is already listed under my plan. It was a bunch of worksheets that I have access to on my own. I have been asking for updates on medication and what is actually offered to no avail. As a licensed counselor it was so disheartening to see this level of apathy within my own profession. I apologize to any other clients who have not had success with this company and wish them all the best in seeking services elsewhere as I plan to do the same. It also would appear that any good review comes from the company itself or those who just need med management.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"Two weeks ago I was supposed to receive my shipment of medication. The problem is I moved. I promptly changed my address in the app (two weeks before I was due for a shipment), but they still sent it to the wrong house. 

I told them immediately what had happened and they told me to give them pharmacy info to send it there. Once I did one of my medications had an insurance hold. My team did not do anything about this until I went to the pharmacy, found out, and messaged them in the app. 

I was told to put my insurance in the app, but that is impossible because my insurer is not an option for their insurance. It wasn’t until I called that they were able to input the insurance info. 

It is now two weeks later, one week of which I have been without any of my main medication, and they are finally telling me that they could ship me some to get it to me sooner.

This is the most unorganized business I have ever dealt with. I work in customer service so I understand that all of their tactics so far are cover ups for “I forgot” or “I didn’t do my job.”

Get it together Cerebral!!! You deal with the mentally ill. We cannot handle this garbage.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"What a waste of money.  You have to pay up front for a month of therapy and/or meds support, THEN you get the opportunity to select your doctors.  But wait, the therapists aren’t available for 1-3 weeks.  So you pay for the service, but you don’t actually receive what you’re paying for.  And if you make the mistake I did and select a therapist who isn’t available for OVER 3 weeks, you can’t just unselect them in the app and choose someone else.  You have to go back and forth with customer service suggesting therapists until they suggest someone you like.  I signed up THREE WEEKS AGO YESTERDAY and I STILL DO NOT HAVE A THERAPIST.  Oh, but they’ll take my money anyway NO PROBLEM.  Haven’t heard back from customer service in 2 days.  I feel like I’ve been totally ripped off; this is just one more example of how difficult it is to get mental healthcare.

ALSO, I didn’t have the opportunity to approve the cost of my meds.  They just charged my card and sent them.  It was only $20, but it’s still crazy to not be able to approve or decline the transaction because by law you can’t return meds once they’re dispensed to you.

Not only that, but the only way to schedule your next appointment is to click on a link they send you that expires in 24 hours.  I missed the 24 hour window twice, and they did not send the link a third time despite my requesting that they send it yet again.  Which is fine, because there’s a 50% chance I would have missed it a third time as well and I’m so disappointed and frustrated with this whole experience that I do not want to continue using the service.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I signed up for this after beginning therapy with a counselor outside this app. Since signing up I’ve met with a nurse practitioner to go over my meds I currently take. Nothing change and I had an as needed med added. After our conversation I was informed I would have a care counselor. 
As of today…I have paid for my services and still have issues. 
1. I can’t log into the app. I’ve emailed with the error code 2-3 times with no response. 
2. I do not have a care counselor assigned to talk to. 
3. I’ve emailed about my insurance, because it is covered through it with no response. 
4. When trying to use the chat online (not through app that doesn’t work) it doesn’t send what I write. It’s a blank screen after I type and send my concerns. 

I need a PERSON to talk to. Not an email or robot to fix these issues. I’m highly upset and this app defeats the purpose of helping those with mental health struggles.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,Do not download this app do not give them your credit card number or your personal information and especially your insurance information. Because it’s seems to be impossible to cancel this service. They do only take $20.00 from your card after that you will get billed your portion that your insurance evidently didn’t cover  for services you didn’t agree to or know about . You will get text messages and reminders for appointments  they  make for you  even after you thought you canceled the service.If like me you need psychiatric prescription medication you will only find out after you’ve signed up that Cerebral doesn’t offer prescription medication as part of your therapy  claiming state laws making it illegal,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,So I read the terms of condition get super excited over how convenient on the telephone will be. Sounds completely amazing right? Complete opposite. They have a list of conditions that they are not allowed to help. Which they conveniently do not tell you or list anywhere.You don’t qualify for counseling you don’t qualify for psychiatric help. However none of this is made it public knowledge before you sign it . You find out when you meet a psychiatrist and they say literally within the first five minutes there’s nothing we can do for you but you can talk to the counselor and they say exactly the same thing. Surprise surprise yet another person who can’t help you and you know what the counselor says let me talk to the company and see if I can still do it weeks go by and they try to charge your card a second time. All you Get out of this is 10 minutes of people telling you they can’t help you and you said $150. In this case convenience is not the best option. Think twice!!!!,cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"I would give this 0 stars if I could. They let you think it’s 30.00, but that’s only for the first month. They surprise charge you $85.00 MINIMUM the next month.  They lack communication. Not only did I not get my rx in the 2 days like they advertise, but the “care councilor” scheduled an appt with me and never entered it. Found out when I inquired about it they said she left...I never got word about it from anyone.  On top of it all they sent me a new counselor who decided to inform me that it was basically my fault for not saying anything to let them know she left.... they don’t read your messages since you will have to repeatedly ask the same thing multiple times. Go with your insurance or a REAL clinical office, because this app is a joke and not worth the hassle, time and frustration you will receive as “care”. Not even worth being free.",cerebral-mental-health,,,
1,"My provider missed our first appointment and has yet to message me anything. I could reschedule, but not for 2 weeks and by then I’ll have been waiting a month. .",cerebral-mental-health,,,
